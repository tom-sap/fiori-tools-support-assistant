Overview
SAP BTP Connectivity allows SAP BTP applications to securely access remote services that run on the Internet or on-premise.
This component:
Allows subaccount-speci c con guration of application connections via destinations.
Provides a Java API that application developers can use to consume remote services.
Allows you to make connections to on-premise systems, using the Cloud Connector.
Lets you establish a secure tunnel from your on-premise network to applications on SAP BTP, while you keep full control
and auditability of what is exposed to the cloud.
Supports both the Neo and the Cloud Foundry environment for application development on SAP BTP.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

5/19/2023

A typical scenario for connecting your on-premise network to SAP BTP looks like this:
Your company owns a global account on SAP BTP and one or more subaccounts that are assigned to this global account.
Using SAP BTP, you subscribe to or deploy your own applications.
To connect to these applications from your on-premise network, the Cloud Connector administrator sets up a secure
tunnel to your company's subaccount on SAP BTP.
The platform ensures that the tunnel can only be used by applications that are assigned to your subaccount.
Applications assigned to other (sub)accounts cannot access the tunnel. It is encrypted via transport layer security (TLS),
which guarantees connection privacy.
For inbound connections (calling an application or service on SAP BTP from an external source), you can use Cloud Connector
service channels (on-premise connections) or the respective API endpoints of your SAP BTP region (Internet connections).

General
Topic

Restriction

Java Connector

To develop a Java Connector (JCo) application for RFC
communication, your SDK local runtime must be hosted by a 64-bit
JVM, on a x86_64 operating system (Microsoft Windows OS, Linux
OS, or Mac OS X).
On Windows platforms, you must install the Microsoft Visual
Studio C++ 2013 runtime libraries (vcredist_x64.exe), see Visual
C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013

Ports

.

For Internet connections, you are allowed to use any port >1024. For
cloud to on-premise solutions there are no port limitations.

Destination Con guration

You can use destination con guration les with extension

.props, .properties, .jks, and .txt, as well as les
with no extension.
If a destination con guration consists of a keystore or
truststore, it must be stored in JKS les with a standard

.jks extension.

Context
The Cloud Connector:
Serves as a link between SAP BTP applications and on-premise systems.
Combines an easy setup with a clear con guration of the systems that are exposed to the SAP BTP.
Lets you use existing on-premise assets without exposing the entire internal landscape.
Runs as on-premise agent in a secured network.
Acts as a reverse invoke proxy between the on-premise network and SAP BTP.
Provides ne-grained control over:
On-premise systems and resources that can be accessed by cloud applications.
Cloud applications using the Cloud Connector.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

5/19/2023

Lets you use the features that are required for business-critical enterprise scenarios.
Recovers broken connections automatically.
Provides audit logging of inbound traﬃc and con guration changes.
Can be run in a high-availability setup.

 Caution
The Cloud Connector must not be used to connect to products other than SAP BTP or S/4HANA Cloud.

Back to Content

Advantages
Compared to the approach of opening ports in the rewall and using reverse proxies in the DMZ to establish access to onpremise systems, the Cloud Connector oﬀers the following bene ts:
You don't need to con gure the on-premise rewall to allow external access from SAP BTP to internal systems. For
allowed outbound connections, no modi cations are required.
The Cloud Connector supports HTTP as well as additional protocols. For example, the RFC protocol supports native
access to ABAP systems by invoking function modules.
You can use the Cloud Connector to connect on-premise databases or BI tools to SAP HANA databases in the cloud.
The Cloud Connector lets you propagate the identity of cloud users to on-premise systems in a secure way.
Easy installation and con guration, which means that the Cloud Connector comes with a low TCO and is tailored to t
your cloud scenarios.
SAP provides standard support for the Cloud Connector.

5/19/2023

Choose a procedure to install the Cloud Connector on your operating system.

Portable Version vs. Installer Version
On Microsoft Windows and Linux, two installation modes are available: a portable version and an installer version. On Mac OS X,
only the portable version is available.

Portable version: can be installed easily, by extracting a compressed archive into an empty directory. It does not require
administrator or root privileges for the installation, and you can run multiple instances on the same host.
Restrictions:
You cannot run it in the background as a Windows Service or Linux daemon (with automatic start capabilities at
boot time).
The portable version does not support an automatic upgrade procedure. To update a portable installation, you
must delete the current one, extract the new version, and then re-do the con guration.
Portable versions are meant for non-productive scenarios only.
The environment variable JAVA_HOME is relevant when starting the instance, and therefore must be set properly.

Installer version: requires administrator or root permissions for the installation and can be set up to run as a Windows
service or Linux daemon in the background. You can upgrade it easily, retaining all the con guration and customizing.

 Note
We strongly recommend that you use this variant for a productive setup.

 Caution
Cloud Connector is based on Tomcat.
Tomcat is a well-known and well-documented server, whose con guration can be adapted to one's own needs. However, we
strongly recommend that you do not modify its con guration les like conf\server.xml with a text editor, because the
Cloud Connector is making assumptions about the content of those les.
If you still want to do custom modi cations, you do so at your own risk. In this case, we can no longer guarantee that the
Cloud Connector keeps working as expected. For any issues that can be traced back to such changes, we cannot provide
support, in particular, if such changes cause trouble during upgrade to a newer version.

Prerequisites
There are some general prerequisites you must ful ll to successfully install the Cloud Connector, see Prerequisites.
For OS-speci c requirements and procedures, see section Tasks below.

 Note
If you install the Cloud Connector in a network segment that is isolated from the backend systems, make sure the exposed
hosts and ports are still reachable and open them in the rewall that protects them:
for HTTP, the ports you chose for the HTTP/S server.
for LDAP, the port of the LDAP server.
for RFC, it depends on whether you use an SAProuter or not and whether load balancing is used:
if you use an SAProuter, it is typically con gured as visible in the network of the Cloud Connector and the
corresponding routtab is exposing all the systems that should be used.
without SAProuter, you must open the application server hosts and the corresponding gateway ports (33##,
48##). When using load balancing for the connection, you must also open the message server host and port.

System Requirements
Additional system requirements for installing and running the Cloud Connector.

Supported Browsers
The browsers you can use for the Cloud Connector Administration UI are the same as those currently supported by SAPUI5.
See: Browser and Platform Support.

Minimum Disk Space for Download and Installation
The minimum free disk space required to download and install a new Cloud Connector server is as follows:
Size of downloaded Cloud Connector installation le (ZIP, TAR, MSI les): 50 MB
Newly installed Cloud Connector server: 70 MB
Total: 120 MB as a minimum

Additional Disk Space for Log and Con guration Files
The Cloud Connector writes con guration les, audit log les and trace les at runtime. We recommend that you reserve
between 1 and 20 GB of disk space for those les.
Trace and log les are written to <scc_dir>/log/ within the Cloud Connector root directory. The ljs_trace.log le contains
traces in general, communication payload traces are stored in traﬃc_trace_*.trc. These les may be used by SAP Support to
analyze potential issues. The default trace level is Information, where the amount of written data is generally only a few KB
per day. You can turn oﬀ these traces to save disk space. However, we recommend that you don't turn oﬀ this trace completely,
but that you leave it at the default settings, to allow root cause analysis if an issue occurs. If you set the trace level to All, the
amount of data can easily reach the range of several GB per day. Use trace level All only to analyze a speci c issue. Payload
trace, however, should normally be turned oﬀ, and used only for analysis by SAP Support.

 Note
Regularly back up or delete written trace les to clean up the used disk space.

Audit log les are written to /log/audit/<subaccount-name>/audit-log_<subaccount-name>_<date>.csv within
the Cloud Connector root directory. By default, only security-related events are written in the audit log. You can change the

audit log level using the administration UI, as described in Manage Audit Logs.
To be compliant with the regulatory requirements of your organization and the regional laws, the audit log les must be
persisted for a certain period of time for traceability purposes. Therefore, we recommend that you back up the audit log les
regularly from the Cloud Connector le system and keep the backup for the length of time required.

Related Information
Prerequisites

Network Zones
Choose a network zone for your Cloud Connector installation.
A customer network is usually divided into multiple network zones or subnetworks according to the security level of the
contained components. For example, the DMZ that contains and exposes the external-facing services of an organization to an
untrusted network, usually the Internet, and there are one or more other network zones which contain the components and
services provided in the company’s intranet.
You can generally choose the network zone in which to set up the Cloud Connector:
Internet access to the SAP BTP region host, either directly or via HTTPS proxy.
Direct access to the internal systems it provides access to, which means that there is transparent connectivity between
the Cloud Connector and the internal system.
The Cloud Connector can be set up either in the DMZ and operated centrally by the IT department, or set up in the intranet and
operated by the appropriate line of business.

 Note
The internal network must allow access to the required ports; the speci c con guration depends on the rewall software
used.
The default ports are 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS. For RFC communication, you need to open a gateway port (default:

33+<instance number> and an arbitrary message server port. For a connection to a HANA Database (on SAP BTP) via
JDBC, you need to open an arbitrary outbound port in your network. Mail (SMTP) communication is not supported.

Sizing Recommendations
When installing a Cloud Connector, the rst thing you need to decide is the sizing of the installation.
This section gives some basic guidance what to consider for this decision. The provided information includes the shadow
instance, which should always be added in productive setups. See also Install a Failover Instance for High Availability.

 Note
The following recommendations are based on current experiences. However, they are only a rule of thumb since the actual
performance strongly depends on the speci c environment. The overall performance of a Cloud Connector is impacted by
many factors (number of hosted subaccounts, bandwidth, latency to the attached regions, network routers in the corporate
network, used JVM, and others).

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

5/19/2023

Restrictions
The sizing data refer to a single Cloud Connector installation.

 Note
Up until now, you cannot perform horizontal scaling directly. However, you can distribute the load statically by operating
multiple Cloud Connector installations with diﬀerent location IDs for all involved subaccounts. In this scenario, you can use
multiple destinations with virtually the same con guration, except for the location ID. See also Managing Subaccounts, step
4. Alternatively, each of the Cloud Connector instances can host its own list of subaccounts without any overlap in the
respective lists. Thus, you can handle more load, if a single installation risks to be overloaded.

Hardware Setup
Con guration Setup

Hardware Setup
How to choose the right sizing for your Cloud Connector installation.
Regarding the hardware, we recommend that you use diﬀerent setups for master and shadow. One dedicated machine should
be used for the master, another one for the shadow. Usually, a shadow instance takes over the master role only temporarily.
During most of its lifetime, in the shadow state, it needs less resources compared to the master.
If the master instance is available again after a downtime, we recommend that you switch back to the actual master.

 Note
The sizing recommendations refer to the overall load across all subaccounts that are connected via the Cloud Connector.
This means that you need to accumulate the expected load of all subaccounts and should not only calculate separately per
subaccount (taking the one with the highest load as basis).

Related Information
Sizing for the Master Instance

Sizing for the Master Instance
Learn more about the basic criteria for the sizing of your Cloud Connector master instance.
For the master setup, keep in mind the expected load for communication between the SAP BTP and on-premise systems. The
setups listed below diﬀer in a mostly qualitative manner, without hard limits for each of them.

 Note
The mentioned sizes are considered as minimal con guration, larger ones are always ok. In general, the more applications,
application instances, and subaccounts are connected, the more competition will exist for the limited resources on the
machine.

In addition, many service

should be on a host without
overcommitted resources.

The expected load is large
(more than 10 million requests

should be on a host without

Particularly the heap size is critical. If you size it too low for the load passing the Cloud Connector, at some point the Java
Virtual Machine will execute full GCs (garbage collections) more frequently, blocking the processing of the Cloud Connector

you should increase the heap size in the Cloud Connector UI (choose

the Java VM.

 Note
You should use the same value for both <initial heap size> and <maximum heap size>.

Sizing for the Shadow Instance
Learn more about the basic criteria for the sizing of your Cloud Connector shadow instance (high availability mode).
The shadow installation is typically not used in standard situations and hence does not need the same sizing, assuming that the
time span in which it takes over the master role is limited.

 Note
The shadow only acts as master, for example, during an upgrade or when an abnormal situation occurs on the master
machine, and either the Cloud Connector or the full machine on OS level needs to be restarted.

While being in the shadow state, the resource consumption is very low, especially in productive environments, where typically
only few con guration changes are required. Therefore, the machine sizing can usually be smaller than the one for the master.
However, if you want to mitigate the risk of a longer outage of the master machine, you should increase the sizing of the shadow
up to the master size:
Master

S installation as virtual machine

M

S installation (with double memory) as virtual or physical machine
M installation as virtual or physical machine for risk mitigation

L

L installation as virtual or physical machine for risk mitigation

Con guration Setup
Choose the right connection con guration options to improve the performance of the Cloud Connector.
This section provides detailed information how you can adjust the con guration to improve overall performance. This is typically
relevant for an M or L installation (see Hardware Setup). For S installations, the default con guration will probably be suﬃcient
to handle the traﬃc.
To change the connection parameters, proceed as follows:
As of Cloud Connector 2.11, you can con gure the number of physical connections through the Cloud Connector UI. See
also Con gure Advanced Connectivity.
In versions prior to 2.11, you have to modify the con guration les with an editor and restart the Cloud Connector to
activate the changes.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

In general, the Cloud Connector tunnel is multiplexing multiple virtual connections over a single physical connection. Thus, a
single connection can handle a considerable amount of traﬃc. However, increasing the maximum number of physical
connections allows you to make use of the full available bandwidth and to minimize latency eﬀects.
If the bandwidth limit of your network is reached, adding additional connections doesn't increase the througput, but will only
consume more resources.

 Note
Diﬀerent network access parameters may impact and limit your con guration options: if the access to an external network is
a 1 MB line with an added latency of 50 ms, you will not be able to achieve the same data volumes like with a 10 GB line with
an added latency of < 1 ms. However, even if the line is good, for example 10 GB, but with an added latency of 100 ms, the
performance might still be bad.

Optimal con guration strongly depends on your actual scenarios. A good approach is to try out diﬀerent settings, if the current
performance does not meet your expectations.

Related Information
On-Demand To On-Premise Connections
On-Premise To On-Demand Connections (Service Channels)

On-Demand To On-Premise Connections
Con gure the physical connections for on-demand to on-premise calls in the Cloud Connector.
Adjusting the number of physical connections for this direction is possible both globally in the Cloud Connector UI (
Con guration

Advanced ), and for individual communication partners on cloud side ( On-Demand To On-Premise

Applications ).
Connections are established for each de ned and connected subaccount. The current number of opened connections is visible in
the Cloud Connector UI via

<Subaccount>

Cloud Connections .

The global default is 1 physical connection per connected subaccount. This value is used across all subaccounts hosted by the
Cloud Connector instance and applies for all communication partners.
In general, the default should be suﬃcient for applications with low traﬃc. If you expect medium traﬃc for most applications, it
may be useful to set the default value to 2.

 Note
An exact traﬃc forecast is diﬃcult to achieve. It requires a deep understanding of the use case and of the possible future
load generated by diﬀerent applications. For this reason, we recommend that you focus on subsequent con guration
adjustments, using the Cloud Connector monitoring tools to recognize bottlenecks in time, and adjust Cloud Connector
con guration accordingly.

Tunnel Worker Threads
In addition to the number of connections, you can con gure the number of <Tunnel Worker Threads>. This value should be at
least equal to the maximum of all individual application tunnel connections in all subaccounts, to have at least 1 thread available
for each connection that can process incoming requests and outgoing responses.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

26

5/19/2023

Protocol Processor Worker Threads
The value for <Protocol Processor Worker Threads> is mainly relevant if RFC is used as protocol. Since its communication model
towards the ABAP system is a blocking one, each thread can handle only one call at a time and cannot be shared. Hence, you
should provide 1 thread per 5 concurrent RFC requests.

 Note
The longer the RFC execution time in the backend, the more threads you should provide. Threads can be reused only after
the response of a call was returned to SAP BTP.

On-Premise To On-Demand Connections (Service Channels)
Con gure the number of physical connections for a Cloud Connector service channel.
Service channels let you con gure the number of physical connections to the communication partner on cloud side, see Using
Service Channels. The default is 1. This value is used as well in versions prior to Cloud Connector 2.11, which did not oﬀer a
con guration option for each service channel. You should de ne the number of connections depending on the expected number
of clients and, with lower priority, depending on the size of the exchanged messages.
If there is only a single RFC client for an S/4HANA Cloud channel or only a single HANA client for a HANA DB on SAP BTP side,
increasing the number doesn't help, as each virtual connection is assigned to one physical connection. The following simple rule
lets you to de ne the required number of connections per service channel:
Per 10 concurrent clients, use one physical connection.
If the transferred net data size is larger than 500k per request, make sure to add an additional connection per 2 of such
clients.

Example
For a HANA system in the SAP BTP, data is replicated using 18 concurrent clients in the on-premise network. In average, about 5
of those clients are regularly sending 600k. For the number of clients, you should use 2 physical connections, for the 5 clients
sending larger amounts add an additional 3, which sums up to 5 connections.

Installation on Microsoft Windows OS
Installing the Cloud Connector on a Microsoft Windows operating system.

Context
You can choose between a simple portable variant of the Cloud Connector and the MSI-based installer. The installer is the
generally recommended version that you can use for both developer and productive scenarios. It lets you, for example, register
the Cloud Connector as a Windows service and this way automatically start it after machine reboot.

 Tip
If you are a developer, you might want to use the portable variant as you can run the Cloud Connector after a simple unzip
(archive extraction). You might want to use it also if you cannot perform a full installation due to lack of permissions, or if you
want to use multiple versions of the Cloud Connector simultaneously on the same machine.

Prerequisites
You have one of the supported 64-bit operating systems. For more information, see Product Availability Matrix.
You have downloaded either the portable variant as ZIP archive for Windows, or the MSI installer from the SAP
Development Tools for Eclipse page.
You must install Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2013 and (for the latest SAP JVM versions) Microsoft Visual Studio C++
2019 runtime libraries (download vcredist_x64.exe for each version). For more information, see Visual C++
Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013
downloads

and Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable latest supported

.

 Note
Even with the more recent version 2019, you still must install the Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2013 libraries, since
they are needed for the Cloud Connector.
A supported Java version must be installed. For more information, see JDKs.
If you want to use SAP JVM, you can download it from the SAP Development Tools for Eclipse page.
When using the portable variant, the environment variable <JAVA_HOME> must be set to the Java installation directory,
so that the bin subdirectory can be found. Alternatively, you can add the relevant bin subdirectory to the <PATH>
variable.

Portable Scenario
1. Extract the <sapcc-<version>-windows-x64.zip> ZIP le to an arbitrary directory on your local le system.
2. Set the environment variable JAVA_HOME to the installation directory of the JDK that you want to use to run the Cloud
Connector. Alternatively, you can add the bin subdirectory of the JDK installation directory to the PATH environment
variable.
3. Go to the Cloud Connector installation directory and start it using the go.bat batch le.
4. Continue with the Next Steps section.

 Note
The Cloud Connector is not started as a service when using the portable variant, and hence will not automatically start after
a reboot of your system. Also, the portable version does not support the automatic upgrade procedure.sapcc-<version>windows-x64.msi

Installer Scenario
1. Start the <>sapcc- installer by double-clicking it.
2. The installer informs you that you are now guided through the installation process. Choose Next>.
3. Navigate to the desired installation directory for your Cloud Connector and choose Next>. When doing the installation in
the context of an upgrade, make sure you choose the previous installation directory again.
4. You can choose the port on which the administration UI is reachable. Either leave the default 8443 or choose a diﬀerent
port if needed. Then, choose Next>.
5. Select the JDK to be used for running the Cloud Connector. The installer displays a list of all usable JDKs that are
installed on your machine. If the needed JDK is not listed in the drop-down box (for example, if it's an SAP JVM that is not
registered in the Windows registry upon installation), you can browse to its installation directory and select it. We
recommend that you use an up-to-date Java 8 installation to run the Cloud Connector.
6. Decide whether the Cloud Connector should be started immediately after nishing the setup. Then, choose Next>.
7. To start the installation, press the Next> button again.

8. After successful installation, choose Close.
9. Continue with the Next Steps section.

 Note
The Cloud Connector is started as a Windows service in the productive use case. Therefore, installation requires
administration permissions. After installation, manage this service under

Control Panel

Administrative Tools

Services

. The service name is Cloud Connector (formerly named Cloud Connector 2.0). Make sure the service is executed
with a user that has limited privileges. Typically, privileges allowed for service users are de ned by your company policy.
Adjust the folder and le permissions to be manageable by only this user and system administrators.

On Windows, the le scc_service.log is created and used by the Microsoft MSI installer (during Cloud Connector
installation), and by the scchost.exe executable, which registers and runs the Windows service if you install the Cloud
Connector as a Windows background job.
This log le is only needed if a problem occurs during Cloud Connector installation, or during creation and start of the Windows
service, in which the Cloud Connector is running. You can nd the le in the log folder of your Cloud Connector installation
directory.

Starting the Cloud Connector
After installation, the Cloud Connector is registered as a Windows service that is con gured to be started automatically after a
system reboot. You can start and stop the service via shortcuts on the desktop ("Start Cloud Connector" and "Stop Cloud
Connector"), or by using the Windows Services manager and look for the service SAP Cloud Connector.
Access the Cloud Connector administration UI at https://localhost:<port>, where the default port is 8443 (but this port might
have been modi ed during the installation).

Next Steps
1. Open a browser and enter: https://<hostname>:8443. <hostname> is the host name of the machine on which you
have installed the Cloud Connector. If you access the Cloud Connector locally from the same machine, you can simply
enter localhost.
2. Continue with the initial con guration of the Cloud Connector, see Initial Con guration.

Installation on Linux OS
Installing the Cloud Connector on a Linux operating system.

Context
You can choose between a simple portable variant of the Cloud Connector and the RPM-based installer. The installer is the
generally recommended version that you can use for both the developer and the productive scenario. It registers, for example,
the Cloud Connector as a daemon service and this way automatically starts it after machine reboot.

If you are a developer, you might want to use the portable variant as you can run the Cloud Connector after a simple "tar -

xzof" execution. You also might want to use it if you cannot perform a full installation due to missing permissions for the
operating system, or if you want to use multiple versions of the Cloud Connector simultaneously on the same machine.

Prerequisites
You have one of the supported 64-bit operating systems. For more information, see Product Availability Matrix.
The supported platforms are x64 and ppc64le, represented below by the variable <platform>. Variable <arch> is
x86_64 or ppc64le respectively.
You have downloaded either the portable variant as tar.gz archive for Linux or the RPM installer contained in the ZIP
for Linux, from SAP Development Tools for Eclipse.
A supported Java version must be installed. For more information, see JDKs.
If you want to use SAP JVM, you can download it from the SAP Development Tools for Eclipse page.
Use the following command to install it:
rpm -i sapjvm-<version>-linux-<platform>.rpm
If you want to check the JVM version installed on your system, use the following command:
rpm -qa | grep jvm
When installing it using the RPM package, the Cloud Connector will detect it and use it for its runtime.
When using the tar.gz archive, the environment variable <JAVA_HOME> must be set to the Java installation directory,
so that the bin subdirectory can be found. Alternatively, you can add the Java installation's bin subdirectory to the
<PATH> variable.

Portable Scenario
1. Extract the tar.gz le to an arbitrary directory on your local le system using the following command:
tar -xzof sapcc-<version>-linux-<platform>.tar.gz

 Note
If you use the parameter "o", the extracted les are assigned to the user ID and the group ID of the user who has
unpacked the archive. This is the default behavior for users other than the root user.
2. Go to this directory and start the Cloud Connector using the go.sh script.
3. Continue with the Next Steps section.

 Note
In this case, the Cloud Connector is not started as a daemon, and therefore will not automatically start after a reboot of your
system. Also, the portable version does not support the automatic upgrade procedure.

Installer Scenario
1. Extract the sapcc-<version>-linux-<platform>.zip archive to an arbitrary directory by using the following the command:
unzip sapcc-<version>-linux-<platform>.zip
2. Go to this directory and install the extracted RPM using the following command. You can perform this step only as a root
user.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

30

5/19/2023

rpm -i com.sap.scc-ui-<version>.<arch>.rpm
3. Continue with the Next Steps section.
In the productive case, the Cloud Connector is started as a daemon. If you need to manage the daemon process, execute:
System V init distributions: service scc_daemon stop|restart|start|status
systemd distributions: systemctl stop|restart|start|status scc_daemon

 Caution
When adjusting the Cloud Connector installation (for example, restoring a backup), make sure the RPM package
management is synchronized with such changes. If you simply replace les that do not t to the information stored in the
package management, lifecycle operations (such as upgrade or uninstallation) might fail with errors. Also, the Cloud
Connector might get into unrecoverable state.
Example: After a le system restore, the system les represent Cloud Connector 2.3.0 but the RPM package management
"believes" that version 2.4.3 is installed. In this case, commands like rpm -U and rpm -e do not work as expected.
Furthermore, avoid using the --force parameter as it may lead to an unpredictable state with two versions being installed
concurrently, which is not supported.

Extending the Daemon (as of Cloud Connector version 2.12.3)
When using SNC for encrypting RFC communication, it might be required to provide some settings, for example, environment
variables that must be visible for the Cloud Connector process. To achieve this, you must store a le named

scc_daemon_extension.sh in the installation directory of the Cloud Connector (/opt/sap/scc), containing all commands
needed for initialization without a shebang.
Example (SAP Cryptographic Library requires SECUDIR to be set):

 Sample Code
export SECUDIR=/path/to/psefile

To activate it, you must reinstall the daemon. Make sure JAVA_HOME is set to the JVM used. Then execute the following
command to reinstall the daemon:
System V init distributions: /opt/sap/scc/daemon.sh reinstall
systemd distributions: /opt/sap/scc/daemon.sh reinstallSystemd

The daemon extension will survive Cloud Connector version updates.

Starting the Cloud Connector
After installation via RPM manager, the Cloud Connector process is started automatically and registered as a daemon process,
which ensures the automatic restart of the Cloud Connector after a system reboot.
To start, stop, or restart the process explicitly, open a command shell and use the following commands, which require root
permissions:
System V init distributions: service scc_daemon start|stop|restart
systemd distributions: systemctl start|stop|restart scc_daemon

Installation on Mac OS X
Installing the Cloud Connector on a Mac OS X operating system.

Prerequisites
 Note
Mac OS X is not supported for productive scenarios. The developer version described below must not be used as productive
version.

 Caution
The Cloud Connector does not natively support the M1/M2 architecture yet. Make sure you use a JVM based on the x64 CPU
architecture, and not the aarch64 one.

You have one of the supported 64-bit operating systems. For more information, see Product Availability Matrix.
You have downloaded the tar.gz archive for the developer use case on Mac OS X from SAP Development Tools for
Eclipse.
A supported Java version must be installed. For more information, see JDKs.
If you want to use SAP JVM, you can download it from the SAP Development Tools for Eclipse page.
Environment variable <JAVA_HOME> must be set to the Java installation directory so that the bin subdirectory can be

Recommendations for Secure Setup

Recommendations for Secure Setup
For the Connectivity service and the Cloud Connector, you should apply the following guidelines to guarantee the highest level of
security for these components.

Security Status
From the Connector menu, choose Security Status to access an overview showing potential security risks and the
recommended actions.

The General Security Status addresses security topics that are subaccount-independent.
Choose any of the Actions icons in the corresponding line to navigate to the UI area that deals with that particular topic
and view or edit details.

 Note
Navigation is not possible for the last item in the list (Service User).

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

33

5/19/2023

The service user is speci c to the Windows operating system (see Installation on Microsoft Windows OS for details) and
is only visible when running the Cloud Connector on Windows. It cannot be accessed or edited through the UI. If the
service user was set up properly, choose Edit and check the corresponding checkbox.
The Subaccount-Speci c Security Status lists security-related information for each and every subaccount.

 Note
The security status only serves as a reminder to address security issues and shows if your installation complies with all
recommended security settings.

UI Access
Upon installation, the Cloud Connector provides an initial user name and password for the administration UI, and forces the
user (Administrator) to change the password. You must change the password immediately after installation.
The connector itself does not check the strength of the password. You should select a strong password that cannot be guessed
easily.

 Note
To enforce your company's password policy, we recommend that you con gure the Administration UI to use an LDAP server
for authorizing access to the UI.

The default user store is a local le store. It allows only one user, and only the Administrator role for this user. Using an LDAP
server as user store lets you create various users to access the UI, and assign diﬀerent roles to them. For more information on
available roles, see Use LDAP for Authentication.
The Cloud Connector administration UI can be accessed remotely via HTTPS. The connector uses a standard X.509 self-signed
certi cate as SSL server certi cate. You can exchange this certi cate with a speci c certi cate that is trusted by your company.
See Exchange UI Certi cates in the Administration UI.

 Note
Since browsers usually do not resolve localhost to the host name whereas the certi cate usually is created under the host
name, you might get a certi cate warning. In this case, simply skip the warning message.

OS-Level Access
The Cloud Connector is a security-critical component that handles the external access to systems of an isolated network,
comparable to a reverse proxy. We therefore recommend that you restrict the access to the operating system on which the
Cloud Connector is installed to the minimal set of users who would administrate the Cloud Connector. This minimizes the risk of
unauthorized users getting access to credentials, such as certi cates stored in the secure storage of the Cloud Connector.
We also recommend that you use the machine to operate only the Cloud Connector and no other systems.

Administrator Privileges
To log on to the Cloud Connector administration UI, the Administrator user of the connector must not have an operating
system (OS) user for the machine on which the connector is running. This allows the OS administrator to be distinguished from
the Cloud Connector administrator. To make an initial connection between the connector and a particular SAP BTP subaccount,
you need an SAP BTP user with the required permissions for the related subaccount. We recommend that you separate these
roles/duties (that means, you have separate users for Cloud Connector administrator and SAP BTP).

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

34

5/19/2023

 Note
We recommend that only a small number of users are granted access to the machine as root users.

Hard Drive Encryption
Hard drive encryption for machines with a Cloud Connector installation ensures that the Cloud Connector con guration data
cannot be read by unauthorized users, even if they obtain access to the hard drive.

Supported Protocols
Currently, the protocols HTTP and RFC are supported for connections between the SAP BTP and on-premise systems when the
Cloud Connector and the Connectivity service are used. The whole route from the application virtual machine in the cloud to the
Cloud Connector is always SSL-encrypted.
The route from the connector to the back-end system can be SSL-encrypted or SNC-encrypted. See Con gure Access Control
(HTTP) and Con gure Access Control (RFC).

Audit Log on OS Level
We recommend that you turn on the audit log on operating system level to monitor the le operations.

Audit Log on Cloud Connector Level
The Cloud Connector audit log must remain switched on during the time it is used with productive systems. The default audit
level is SECURITY. Set it to ALL if required by your company policy. The administrators who are responsible for a running Cloud
Connector must ensure that the audit log les are properly archived, to conform to the local regulations. You should switch on
audit logging also in the connected back-end systems.

Encryption Ciphers
 Tip
Enable all cipher suites that are compatible with the current UI certi cate and are deemed secure as per your company's
and SAP's guidelines. Adapt the cipher suites whenever the UI certi cate is exchanged or the JVM is updated.

Initially, a default set of encryption ciphers is enabled for HTTPS connections to the administration UI. This default set is
determined by the JVM. Some of these ciphers may not be compliant with the UI certi cate, and some of them may not
conform to your or SAP's security standards. They should therefore be excluded.
To enable or disable ciphers, choose Con guration from the main menu and go to tab User Interface, section Cipher Suites.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

35

5/19/2023

The rst column labeled Status Quo shows the current state of all available ciphers. The second column Status New shows the
state the ciphers will have after a restart, if that state diﬀers from the current one (that is, there is no entry in that column if
the state remains the same after a restart).
Ciphers are either enabled or disabled, and they are either compatible or incompatible with the current UI certi cate (that is,
can potentially be used or not be used) . Consult the tooltips of the (four types of) icons for details. The third column shows
SAP's security assessment of the ciphers as per the time of release. Enable or disable individual ciphers using the button in the
Action column. Enable or disable certain groups of ciphers using the appropriate table button. Consult the tooltips for details.

 Note
We recommend that you enable all cipher suites that are compatible with the UI whenever you plan to switch to another
JVM. You can comfortably do so by using the rst button to the right of the lter buttons.
As the set of supported ciphers may diﬀer, the selected ciphers may not be supported by the new JVM. In that case, the
Cloud Connector will not start anymore, and you must x the issue by manually adapting the le conf/server.xml. After a
successful switch, you can adjust the list of eligible ciphers again.

the user name. To change the password in second step, enter the old password, the new one, and the repeated (new)
password, but leave the user name unchanged.

Back toTasks

Set up Connection Parameters and HTTPS Proxy
When logging in for the rst time, the following screen is displayed every time you choose an option from the main menu that
requires a con gured subaccount:

If your internal landscape is protected by a rewall that blocks any outgoing TCP traﬃc, you must specify an HTTPS proxy that
the Cloud Connector can use to connect to SAP BTP. Normally, you must use the same proxy settings as those being used by
your standard Web browser. The Cloud Connector needs this proxy for two operations:
Download the correct connection con guration corresponding to your subaccount ID in SAP BTP.
Establish the SSL tunnel connection from the Cloud Connector user to your SAP BTP subaccount.

 Note
If you want to skip the initial con guration, you can click the

icon in the upper right corner. You might need this in case of

connectivity issues shown in your logs. You can add subaccounts later as described in Managing Subaccounts.

The Cloud Connector collects the following required information for your subaccount connection:
1. For <Region>, specify the SAP BTP region that should be used. You can choose it from the drop-down list, see Regions.

 Note
You can also con gure a region yourself, if it is not part of the standard list. Either insert the region host manually, or
create a custom region, as described in Con gure Custom Regions.
2. For <Subaccount>, <Subaccount User> and <Password>, enter the values you obtained when you registered your
subaccount on SAP BTP.

 Note

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

40

5/19/2023

For a subaccount in the Cloud Foundry environment, you must enter the subaccount ID as <Subaccount>, rather than
its actual (technical) name. For information on getting the subaccount ID, see Find Your Subaccount ID (Cloud
Foundry Environment). As <Subaccount User> you must provide your Login E-mail instead of a user ID. The user
must be a member of the global account the subaccount belongs to.

You can also add a new subaccount user with the role Cloud Connector Admin in the SAP BTP cockpit and use the
new user and password.

 Note
The Cloud Connector does not yet support SAP Universal ID . Please use your S-user or P-user credentials for the

<subaccount user> and <password> elds instead.
For more information, see SAP note 3085908

.

For the Neo environment, see Add Members to Your Neo Subaccount.
For the Cloud Foundry environment, see Add Org Members Using the Cockpit.

 Tip
When using SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication (IAS) as platform identity provider with two-factor
authentication for your subaccount, you can simply append the required token to the regular password.

 Tip
For a subaccount in the Cloud Foundry environment, the Cloud Connector supports the use of a custom identity
provider (IDP) via single sign-on (SSO) passcode. For more information, see Use a Custom IDP for Subaccount
Con guration.
3. (Optional) You can de ne a <Display Name> that lets you easily recognize a speci c subaccount in the UI compared to
the technical subaccount name.
4. (Optional) You can de ne a <Location ID> identifying the location of this Cloud Connector for a speci c subaccount. As of
Cloud Connector release 2.9.0, the location ID is used as routing information and therefore you can connect multiple
Cloud Connectors to a single subaccount. If you don't specify any value for <Location ID>, the default is used, which
represents the behavior of previous Cloud Connector versions. The location ID must be unique per subaccount and
should be an identi er that can be used in a URI. To route requests to a Cloud Connector with a location ID, the location
ID must be con gured in the respective destinations.

 Note
Location IDs provided in older versions of the Cloud Connector are discarded during upgrade to ensure compatibility
for existing scenarios.
5. Enter a suitable proxy host from your network and the port that is speci ed for this proxy. If your network requires an
authentication for the proxy, enter a corresponding proxy user and password. You must specify a proxy server that
supports SSL communication (a standard HTTP proxy does not suﬃce).

 Note
These settings strongly depend on your speci c network setup. If you need more detailed information, please contact
your local system administrator.
6. (Optional) You can provide a <Description> (free-text) of the subaccount that is shown when choosing the Details icon in
the Actions column of the Subaccount Dashboard. It lets you identify the particular Cloud Connector you use.
7. Choose Save.
The Cloud Connector now starts a handshake with SAP BTP and attempts to establish a secure SSL tunnel to the server that

cloud side to any of your internal back-end systems. To allow your on-demand applications to access speci c internal back-end
systems, proceed with the access con guration described in the next section.

 Note
The internal network must allow access to the port. Speci c con guration for opening the respective port(s) depends on the
rewall software used. The default ports are 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS. For RFC communication, you must open a
gateway port (default: 33+<instance number> and an arbitrary message server port. For a connection to a HANA
Database (on SAP BTP) via JDBC, you must open an arbitrary outbound port in your network. Mail (SMTP) communication is

To manually close (and reopen) the connection to SAP BTP, choose your subaccount from the main menu and select the
Disconnect button (or the Connect button to reconnect to SAP BTP).

The green icon next to Region Host indicates that it is valid and can be reached.
If an HTTPS Proxy is con gured, its availability is shown the same way. In the screenshot, the grey diamond icon next to
HTTPS Proxy indicates that connectivity is possible without proxy con guration.
In case of a timeout or a connectivity issue, these icons are yellow (warning) or red (error), and a tooltip shows the cause of the
problem. Initiated By refers to the user that has originally established the tunnel. During normal operations, this user is no
longer needed. Instead, a certi cate is used to open the connection to a subaccount.
The status of the certi cate is shown next to Subaccount Certi cate. It is shown as valid (green icon), if the expiration
date is still far in the future, and turns to yellow if expiration approaches according to your alert settings. It turns red as
soon as it has expired. This is the latest point in time, when you should Update the Certi cate for Your Subaccount.

 Note
When connected, you can monitor the Cloud Connector also in the Connectivity section of the SAP BTP cockpit. There, you
can track attributes like version, description and high availability set up. Every Cloud Connector con gured for your
subaccount automatically appears in the Connectivity section of the cockpit.

requests to backends that request or require a client certi cate. The CA that signed the Cloud Connector's client certi cate
must be trusted by all backend systems to which the Cloud Connector is supposed to connect.
You must provide the system certi cate as PKCS#12 le containing the client certi cate, the corresponding private key and the
CA root certi cate that signed the client certi cate (plus potentially the certi cates of any intermediate CAs, if the certi cate
chain is longer than 2).

Procedure
From the left panel, choose Con guration. On the tab On Premise, choose

to

upload a certi cate and provide its password:

A second option is to start a certi cate signing request procedure as described for the UI certi cate in Exchange UI Certi cates
in the Administration UI and upload the resulting signed certi cate.

As of version 2.10, there is a third option - generating a self-signed certi cate. It might be useful if no CA is needed, for example,
in a demo setup or if you want to use a dedicated CA. For this option, choose Create and import a self-signed certi cate:

Initial Con guration (RFC)
Con gure a Secure Network Connection (SNC) to set up the Cloud Connector for RFC communication to an ABAP backend
system.

SNC Con guration for Mutual Authentication
To set up a mutual authentication between Cloud Connector and an ABAP backend system (connected via RFC), you can
con gure SNC for the Cloud Connector. It will then use the associated PSE for all RFC SNC requests. This means that the SNC
identity, represented by this PSE, must:
Be trusted by all backend systems to which the Cloud Connector is supposed to connect
Play the role of a trusted external system by adding the SNC name of the Cloud Connector to the SNCSYSACL table. You
can nd more details in the SNC con guration documentation for the release of your ABAP system.

Prerequisites
You have con gured your ABAP system(s) for SNC. For detailed information on con guring SNC for an ABAP system, see
also Con guring SNC on AS ABAP.
You have con gured the ABAP System to trust the Cloud Connector's system SNC identity. To do this, or to establish
trust for principal propagation, follow the steps described in Con gure Principal Propagation for RFC.

Con guration Steps
1. Logon to the Cloud Connector
2. Choose Con guration from the main menu and go to tab On Premise, section SNC.
3. Enter the corresponding values in the elds Library Name, My Name, and Quality of Protection
4. Press Save.

Bear in mind that you must use one and the same security product on both sides of the communication.
My Name: The SNC name that identi es the Cloud Connector. It represents a valid scheme for the SNC
implementation that is used.
Quality of Protection: Determines the level of protection that you require for the connectivity to the ABAP
systems.

 Note
When using CommonCryptoLibrary as SNC implementation, note 1525059

will help you to con gure the PSE to be

Using the SAP Cryptographic Library
 Note
This procedure is available as of Cloud Connector version 2.14.1

When using the SAP Cryptographic Library as SNC implementation, you can use the interactive setup scripts which can be
found in the Cloud Connector's installation folder to ease the setup process.

 Note
Using the scripts mentioned below is not mandatory for using the SAP cryptographic library. If you are familiar with the
necessary steps needed for running a process with the desired identity, you can also con gure the SNC setup for the SAP
cryptographic library on your own.

Linux/Mac scripts: snc_create_pse.sh, snc_import_ca_response.sh
Windows scripts: snc_create_pse.bat, snc_import_ca_response.bat
1. Download and extract the SAP Cryptographic Library from the Download Center

Administration and Operations, Neo Environment

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

52

5/19/2023

Context
You can connect to several subaccounts within a single Cloud Connector installation. Those subaccounts can use the Cloud
Connector concurrently with diﬀerent con gurations. By selecting a subaccount from the drop-down box, all tab entries show
the con guration, audit, and state, speci c to this subaccount. In case of audit and traces, cross-subaccount info is merged with
the subaccount-speci c parts of the UI.

 Note
We recommend that you group only subaccounts with the same qualities in a single installation:
Productive subaccounts should reside on a Cloud Connector that is used for productive subaccounts only.
Test and development subaccounts can be merged, depending on the group of users that are supposed to deal with
those subaccounts. However, the preferred logical setup is to have separate development and test installations.

Prerequisites
You have assigned one of these roles/role collections to the subaccount user that you use for initial Cloud Connector setup,
depending on the SAP BTP environment in which your subaccount is running:

 Note
For the Cloud Foundry environment, you must know on which cloud management tools feature set (A or B) your account is
running. For more information on feature sets, see Cloud Management Tools — Feature Set Overview.

Subaccount Dashboard
In the subaccount dashboard (choose your Subaccount from the main menu), you can check the state of all subaccount
connections managed by this Cloud Connector at a glance.

In the screenshot above, the subaccount with display name trial (actual subaccount ID starts with ab1220dc-5bfb-45d1-9...) is
already connected, but has no active resources exposed. All other subaccounts are connected with exposed resources and are
fully operational. In addition, depending on the connection state, the dashboard allows you to do disconnect and connect
subaccounts by pressing the respective button in the Actions column. You may also view details of, delete, or navigate to a
subaccount using buttons from the Actions column.
The lter buttons above the dashboard let you lter the shown subaccounts based on the connection status. You can select all
subaccounts, all connected ones, all disconnected ones, all subaccounts currently in connecting or reconnecting status, or all
subaccounts for which establishing the connection has failed.
If you want to connect an additional subaccount with your on-premise landscape, simply press the Add Subaccount button,

Procedure
1. The <Region> eld speci es the SAP BTP region that should be used, for example, Europe (Rot). Choose the one you
need from the drop-down list.

 Remember
The available regions and region domains depend on the SAP BTP environment you are using. For more information,
see Regions (Cloud Foundry and ABAP environment) or Regions and Hosts Available for the Neo Environment.

 Tip
You can also con gure a region yourself, if it is not part of the standard list. Either insert the region host manually, or
create a custom region, as described in Con gure Custom Regions.
2. For <Subaccount> and <Subaccount User> (user/password), enter the values you obtained when you registered your
account on SAP BTP.

 Note
If your subaccount is on Cloud Foundry, you must enter the subaccount ID as <Subaccount>, rather than its actual
(technical) name. For information on getting the subaccount ID, see Find Your Subaccount ID (Cloud Foundry
Environment). As <Subaccount User> you must provide your Login E-mail instead of a user ID.
For the Neo environment, enter the subaccount's technical name in the eld <Subaccount>, not the subaccount ID.
Alternatively, you can add a new subaccount user in the SAP BTP cockpit, assign the required authorization (see section
Prerequisites above), and use the new user and password.

 Note

The Cloud Connector does not yet support SAP Universal ID . Please use your S-user or P-user credentials for the

<subaccount user> and <password> elds instead.
For more information, see SAP note 3085908

.

 Tip
When using SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication (IAS) as platform identity provider with two-factor
authentication (2FA / MFA) for your subaccount, you can simply append the required token to the regular password.
For example, if your password is "eX7?6rUm" and the one-time passcode is "123456", you must enter "eX7?
6rUm123456" into the <Password> eld.

 Tip
For a subaccount in the Cloud Foundry environment, the Cloud Connector supports the use of a custom identity
provider (IDP) via single sign-on (SSO) passcode. For more information, see Use a Custom IDP for Subaccount
Con guration.
3. (Optional) You can de ne a <Display Name> that allows you to easily recognize a speci c subaccount in the UI compared
to the technical subaccount name.
4. (Optional) You can de ne a <Location ID> that identi es the location of this Cloud Connector for a speci c subaccount.
As of Cloud Connector release 2.9.0, the location ID is used as routing information and therefore you can connect
multiple Cloud Connectors to a single subaccount. If you don't specify any value for <Location ID>, the default is used,
which represents the behavior of previous Cloud Connector versions. The location ID must be unique per subaccount and
should be an identi er that can be used in a URI. To route requests to a Cloud Connector with a location ID, the location
ID must be con gured in the respective destinations.
5. (Optional) You can provide a <Description> of the subaccount that is shown when clicking on the Details icon in the
Actions column.
6. Choose Save.

Next Steps
To modify an existing subaccount, choose the Edit icon and change the <Display Name>, <Location ID> and/or

Authenticating Users against On-Premise Systems
Authentication types supported by the Cloud Connector.
Currently, the Cloud Connector supports basic authentication and principal propagation (user propagation) as user
authentication types towards internal systems. The destination con guration of the used cloud application de nes which of
these types is used for the actual communication to an on-premise system through the Cloud Connector, see Managing
Destinations.
To use basic authentication, con gure an on-premise system to accept basic authentication and to provide one or
multiple service users. No additional steps are necessary in the Cloud Connector for this authentication type.
To use principal propagation, you must explicitly con gure trust to those cloud entities from which user tokens are
accepted as valid. You can do this in the Trust view of the Cloud Connector, see Set Up Trust for Principal Propagation.

Con gure Trusted Entities in the Cloud Connector
You perform trust con guration to support principal propagation. By default, your Cloud Connector does not trust any entity
that issues tokens for principal propagation. Therefore, the list of trusted identity providers (IdPs) is empty by default.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

63

5/19/2023

If you decide to use the principal propagation feature, you must establish trust to at least one IdP. The following IdP types are
supported:
Neo environment: SAML IdPs.

 Note
In the Neo environment, you can also trust HANA instances and Java applications to act as IdPs.
Cloud Foundry environment: OAuth IdPs.
You can con gure trust to one or more IdPs per subaccount. After you've con gured trust in the cockpit for your subaccount, for
example, to your own company's IdP(s), you can synchronize this list with your Cloud Connector.

From your subaccount menu, choose Cloud to On-Premise and go to the Principal Propagation tab. Choose the Synchronize
button to store the list of existing identity providers locally in your Cloud Connector.
Select an entry to see its details:

Name: the name associated with the identity provider.
Description: descriptive information about this entry.
Type: type of the trusted entity.
Trusted: indicates whether the entry is trusted for principal propagation.
Actions: Choose the Show Certi cate Information icon to display detail information for the corresponding entry. The

Cloud Connector runtime will use the certi cate associated with the entry to verify that the assertion used for principal
propagation was issued by a trusted entity.
You can decide for each entry, whether to trust it for the principal propagation use case by choosing Edit and (de)selecting the
Trusted checkbox.

 Note
Whenever you update a SAML IdP con guration for a subaccount on cloud side, you must synchronize the trusted entities in
theCloud Connector. Otherwise the validation of the forwarded SAML assertion will fail with an exception containing an
exception message similar to this: Caused by: com.sap.engine.lib.xml.signature.SignatureException: Unable to validate

signature -> java.security.SignatureException: Signature decryption error: javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: Invalid

Con gure an On-Premise System for Principal Propagation
Set up principal propagation from SAP BTP to your internal system that is used in a hybrid scenario.

 Note
As a prerequisite for principal propagation for RFC, the following cloud application runtime versions are required:
for Java Web: 1.51.8 or higher
for Java EE 6 Web Pro le: 2.31.11 or higher
other runtimes support it with any version

1. Set up trust to an entity that is issuing an assertion for the logged-on user (see section above).
2. Set up the system identity for the Cloud Connector.
For HTTPS, you must import a system certi cate into your Cloud Connector.
For RFC, you must import an SNC PSE into your Cloud Connector.
3. Con gure the target system to trust the Cloud Connector.
There are two levels of trust:
a. First, you must allow the Cloud Connector to identify itself with its system certi cate (for HTTPS), or with the
SNC PSE (for RFC).
b. Then, you must allow this identity to propagate the user accordingly:
For HTTPS, the Cloud Connector forwards the true identity in a short-lived X.509 certi cate in an HTTP
header named SSL_CLIENT_CERT. The system must use this certi cate for logging on the real user. The
SSL handshake, however, is performed through the system certi cate. For more information on identity
forwarding, see Con gure Access Control (HTTP).
For RFC, the Cloud Connector forwards the true identity as part of the RFC protocol.
For more information, see Con guring Principal Propagation to an ABAP System.
4. Con gure the user mapping in the target system. The X.509 certi cate contains information about the cloud user in its
subject. Use this information to map the identity to the appropriate user in this system. This step applies for both HTTPS
and RFC.

 Note
If you have the following scenario: Application1->AppToAppSS0->Application2->Principal Propagation->On premise Backend

System you must mark Application2 as trusted by the Cloud Connector in tab Principal Propagation, section Trust
Con guration.
If you use an identity provider that issues unsigned assertions, you must mark all relevant applications as trusted by the
Cloud Connector in tab Principal Propagation, section Trust Con guration.

Con gure a CA Certi cate for Principal Propagation
Install and con gure an X.509 certi cate to enable support for principal propagation in the Cloud Connector.

Supported CA Mechanisms
You can enable support for principal propagation with X.509 certi cates by performing either of the following procedures:
Using a Local CA in the Cloud Connector.

 Note
Prior to version 2.7.0, this was the only option and the system certi cate was acting both as client certi cate and CA
certi cate in the context of principal propagation.
Using a Secure Login Server (SLS) and delegate the CA functionality to it.
The Cloud Connector uses the con gured CA approach to issue short-lived certi cates for logging on the same identity in the
back end that is logged on in the cloud. For establishing trust with the back end, the respective con guration steps are
independent of the approach that you choose for the CA.

Install a local CA Certi cate
To issue short-lived certi cates that are used for principal propagation to a back-end system, you can import an X.509 client
certi cate into the Cloud Connector. This CA certi cate must be provided as PKCS#12 le containing the (intermediate)
certi cate, the corresponding private key, and the CA root certi cate that signed the intermediate certi cate (plus the
certi cates of any other intermediate CAs, if the certi cate chain includes more than those two certi cates).
Use either of the following options to install a local CA certi cate:
Option 1: Choose the PKCS#12 le from the le system, using the le upload dialog. For the import process, you must
also provide the le password.
Option 2: Start a Certi cate Signing Request (CSR) procedure like for the UI certi cate, see Exchange UI Certi cates in
the Administration UI.
Option 3: (As of version 2.10) Generate a self-signed certi cate, which might be useful in a demo setup or if you need a
dedicated CA. In particular for this option, it is useful to export the public key of the CA via the button Download
certi cate in DER format.

 Note
The CA certi cate should have the KeyUsage attribute keyCertSign. Many systems verify that the issuer of a certi cate
includes this attribute and deny a client certi cate without this attribute. When using the CSR procedure, the attribute is

requested for the CA certi cate. Also, when generating a self-signed certi cate, this attribute is added automatically.

Choose Import a certi cate for option 1:

Choose Generate a certi cate signing request for option 2:

Choose Create and import a self-signed certi cate if you want to use option 3:

In particular for this option, it is useful to export the public key of the CA by choosing the respective button.

 Caution
The CA certi cate should have the KeyUsage attribute keyCertSign. Many systems verify that the issuer of a certi cate
has this attribute and deny a client certi cate, if this attribute is not present. When using the Certi cate Signing Request
procedure, the attribute will be requested for the CA certi cate. Also, when generating a self-signed certi cate, this
attribute will be added automatically.

After successful import of the CA certi cate, its distinguished name, the name of the issuer, and the validity dates are shown:

If a CA certi cate is no longer required, you can delete it. Use the respective Delete button and con rm the deletion.

If you want to delegate the CA functionality to a Secure Login Server (SLS), choose the CA using the Secure Login Server
option and con gure the SLS as follows, after having con gured the SLS as described in Con gure a Secure Login Server.

A wizard oﬀers in a rst step a quick con guration by metadata URL pointing to the SLS you'd like to use.

Using the metadata URL lets you fetch the most relevant data from SLS instance. You only have to choose the pro le

Con gure the ABAP system to trust the Cloud Connector's system certi cate
Con gure the Internet Communication Manager (ICM) to trust the system certi cate for principal propagation
Con gure the ABAP system to trust the Cloud Connector's system certi cate:
1. Open the Trust Manager (transaction STRUST).
2. Double-click the SSL-Server Standard folder in the menu tree on the left.
3. In the displayed screen, click the Import certi cate button.
4. In the dialog window, choose the certi cate le representing the public key of the issuer of the system certi cate, for
example, in DER format. Typically, this is a CA certi cate. If you decide to use a self-signed system certi cate, it is the
system certi cate itself.
5. The details of this certi cate are shown in the section above. Using the example certi cate data, you would see
CN=MyCompany CA, O=Trust Community, C=DE as subject.
6. If you are sure that you are importing the correct certi cate, you can integrate the certi cate into the certi cate list by
choosing the Add to Certi cate List button.
7. Now, the CA certi cate (CN=MyCompany CA, O=Trust Community, C=DE) is part of the certi cate list.
Back to Step
Con gure the Internet Communication Manager (ICM) to trust the system certi cate for principal propagation:
1. Open the Pro le Editor (transaction RZ10).
2. Select the pro le you want to edit, for example, the DEFAULT pro le.
3. Select the Extended maintenance radio button and choose the Change button.
4. Create the following parameter: icm/trusted_reverse_proxy_<x> = SUBJECT="<subject>", ISSUER="

2. Map Short-Lived Certi cates to Users
For systems later than SAP NetWeaver 7.3 EHP1 (7.31), you can use rule-based certi cate mapping, which is the recommended
way to create the required user mappings. For more information, see Rule-Based Mapping of Certi cates.
In older releases (for which this feature does not exist yet), you can do this manually in the system as described below, or use an
identity management solution generating the mapping table for a more comfortable approach.
1. Open Assignment of External ID to Users (transaction EXTID_DN).
2. Switch to the edit mode.
3. Create a new entry. Specify the subject of the certi cate as External ID . When using the example data, this is
CN=P1234567890. In the User eld, provide the appropriate ABAP user, for example JOHNSMITH.
4. Choose Activate.
5. Save the mapping.
6. Repeat the previous steps for all users that should be supported for the scenario.

corresponding system mapping. This setting lets you use the system certi cate for trust as well as for user
authentication.
For details, see Con gure Access Control (HTTP), step 8 (Procedure for Cloud Connector versions below 2.15).
Additionally, make sure that all required ICF services allow Logon Through SSL Certificate as logon method.
To access ICF services via the logon method Basic Authentication (logon with user/password) and principal
propagation, choose the principal type X.509 Certificate (strict usage) in the corresponding system
mapping. This setting lets you use the system certi cate for trust, but prevents its usage for user authentication.
For details, see Con gure Access Control (HTTP), step 8 (Procedure for Cloud Connector versions below 2.15).
Additionally, make sure that all required ICF services allow Basic Authentication and Logon Through SSL

Certificate as logon methods.
If some of the ICF services require Basic Authentication, while others should be accessed via system certi cate
logon, perform these steps:
1. In the Cloud Connector sytem mapping, choose the principal type X.509 Certificate (general usage) as
described above.
2. In the ABAP system, choose transaction code SICF and go to Maintain Services.
3. Select the service that requires Basic Authentication as logon method.

Con gure SAP Web Dispatcher to Trust the Cloud Connector's System Certi cate
To allow Cloud Connector client certi cates for authentication in the backend system, perform the following two steps:
1. Con gure SAP Web Dispatcher to trust the Cloud Connector's system certi cate:
a. To import the system certi cate to SAP Web Dispatcher, open the SAP Web Dispatcher administration interface
in your browser.

 Note
The interface is usually con gured on /sap/wdisp/admin.
b. In the menu, navigate to SSL and Trust Con guration and select PSE Management.
c. In the Manage PSE section, select SAPSSLS.pse from the drop-down list. By default, SAPSSLS.pse contains the
server certi cate and the list of trusted clients that SAP Web Dispatcher trusts as a server.
d. In the Trusted Certi cates section, choose Import Certi cate.
e. Enter the certi cate as base64-encoded into the text box. The procedure to export your certi cate in such a
format is described in Forward SSL Certi cates for X.509 Authentication, step 1.

 Note
Typically, this is a CA certi cate. If you are using a self-signed system certi cate, it's the system certi cate
itself.
f. Choose Import.
g. The certi cate details are now shown in section Trusted Certi cates.
2. Con gure SAP Web Dispatcher to trust the Cloud Connector's system certi cate for principal propagation:
Create or edit the following parameter in SAP Web Dispatcher:

icm/trusted_reverse_proxy_<x> = SUBJECT="<subject>", ISSUER="<issuer>"
Select a free index for <x>.

Con gure Principal Propagation for RFC
Find step-by-step instructions to con gure principal propagation to an ABAP server for RFC.
Con guring principal propagation for RFC requires an SNC (Secure Network Communications) connection. To enable SNC, you
must con gure the ABAP system and the Cloud Connector accordingly.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

5/19/2023

The following example provides step-by-step instructions for the SNC setup.

 Note
It is important that you use the same SNC implementation on both communication sides. Contact the vendor of your SNC
solution to check the compatibility rules.

Example Data
The following data and setup is used:

 Note
The parameters provided in this example are based on an SNC implementation that uses the SAP Cryptographic Library.
Other vendors' libraries may require diﬀerent values.

An SNC identity has been generated and installed on the Cloud Connector host. Generating this identity for the SAP
Cryptographic Library is typically done using the tool SAPGENPSE. For more information, see Con guring SNC for
SAPCRYPTOLIB Using SAPGENPSE.
The ABAP system is con gured properly for SNC.

 Note
For the latest system releases, you can use the SSO wizard to con gure SNC (transaction code: SNCWIZARD).
System prerequisites are described in SAP note 2015966

.

The Cloud Connector system identity's SNC name is p:CN=SCC, OU=SAP CP Scenarios, O=Trust Community,

C=DE.
The ABAP system's SNC identity name is p:CN=SID, O=Trust Community, C=DE. This value can typically be found
in the ABAP system instance pro le parameter snc/identity/as and hence is provided per application server.
When using the SAP Cryptographic Library, the ABAP system's SNC identity and the Cloud Connector's system identity
should be signed by the same CA for mutual authentication.
The example short-lived certi cate has the subject CN=P1234567, where P1234567 is the SAP BTP application user.

Tasks
1. Con gure the ABAP System
2. Map Short-Lived Certi cates to Users
3. Con gure the Cloud Connector

1. Con gure the ABAP System to Trust the Cloud Connector's System SNC identity
1. Open the SNC Access Control List for Systems (transaction SNC0).
2. As the Cloud Connector does not have a system ID, use an arbitray value for <System ID> and enter it together with its
SNC name: p:CN=SCC, OU=SAP CP Scenarios, O=Trust Community, C=DE.
3. Save the entry and choose the Details button.
4. In the next screen, activate the checkboxes for Entry for RFC activated and Entry for certi cate activated.
5. Save your settings.

2. Map Short-Lived Certi cates to Users
You can do this manually in the system as described below or use an identity management solution for a more comfortable
approach. For example, for large numbers of users the rule-based certi cate mapping is a good way to save time and eﬀort. See
Rule-Based Certi cate Mapping.
1. Open Assignment of External ID to Users (transaction EXTID_DN).
2. Switch to the edit mode.
3. Create a new entry. Specify the subject of the certi cate as External ID . Using the example data, this is CN=P1234567. In
the <User> eld, provide an appropriate ABAP user, for example JOHNDOE.
4. Save the mapping.
5. Repeat the previous steps for all users that should be supported for the scenario.
Back to Tasks
Back to Example Data

3. Con gure the Cloud Connector
Prerequisites
Set up the Cloud Connector to Use the SNC Implementation
Create an RFC Hostname Mapping
Prerequisites
The required security product for the SNC avor that is used by your ABAP back-end systems, is installed on the Cloud
Connector host.
The Cloud Connector's system SNC identity is associated with the operating system user under which the Cloud
Connector process is running.

 Note
If you use SAP Cryptographic Library as SNC implementation, follow the steps described in Initial Con guration (RFC).
Additionally, SAP note 2642538

provides a good description to associate an SNC identity of SAP Cryptographic

Library with a user running an external program that uses JCo. When using a diﬀerent SNC oﬀering, get in touch with
the SNC library vendor for details.

Back to Step
Set up the Cloud Connector to Use the SNC Implementation
1. In the Cloud Connector UI, choose Con guration from the main menu, select the On Premise tab, and go to the SNC
section.
2. Provide the fully quali ed name of the SNC library (the security product's shared library implementing the GSS API), the
SNC name of the above system identity, and the desired quality of protection by choosing the Edit icon.
For more information, see Initial Con guration (RFC).

 Note
This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

79

5/19/2023

The example in Initial Con guration (RFC) shows the library location if you use the SAP Secure Login Client as your
SNC security product. In this case (as well as for some other security products), SNC My Name is optional, because
the security product automatically uses the identity associated with the current operating system user under which
the process is running, so you can leave that eld empty. (Otherwise, in this example it should be lled with

p:CN=SCC, OU=SAP CP Scenarios, O=Trust Community, C=DE.)
We recommend that you enter Maximum Protection for <Quality of Protection>, if your security solution supports
it, as it provides the best protection.

3. Choose Save and Close.
Back to Step
Create an RFC Hostname Mapping
1. In the Access Control section of the Cloud Connector, create a hostname mapping corresponding to the cloud-side RFC
destination. See Con gure Access Control (RFC).
2. Make sure you choose RFC SNC as <Protocol> and ABAP System as <Back-end Type>. In the <SNC Partner Name>
eld, enter the ABAP system's SNC identitiy name, for example, p:CN=SID, O=Trust Community, C=DE.
3. Save your mapping.

The last entry in the table is the default one having no condition (that is, it always matches as fallback). This entry can not be
moved or deleted.
To modify or add table entries, choose the Edit or Add icon:

Specify a Condition
Use either of the following procedures to specify a condition based on the attributes of incoming tokens from cloud side:
Enter the values in the subject pattern elds manually.
Use the selection menu of the corresponding eld to enter a prede ned variable.
Using the selection menu, you can assign values for the following parameters:

${user_type}
${name}
${mail}
${email}
${display_name}
${login_name}

Operators
In a next step, choose an operator:

exists: This attribute must be present in the incoming token.
does not exist : This attribute must not be present in the incoming token.
is: This attribute must be present and equals to the value that has been entered in the third eld afterwards.
is not : This attribute must be present and is not equal to the value that has been entered in the third eld afterwards.

 Note
For the condition ${user_type}, you can only switch between Technical or Business. The latter refers to the
"classical" propagation of business user information, whereas Technical is the propagation of a technical user.

Subject Pattern Details
This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

83

5/19/2023

Use either of the following procedures to de ne the subject's distinguished name (DN), for which the certi cate will be issued:
Enter the values in the subject pattern elds manually.
Use the selection menu of the corresponding eld to enter a prede ned variable.
Using the selection menu, you can assign values for the following parameters:

${name}
${mail}
${display_name}
${login_name}

 Note
If the token provided by the Identity Provider contains additional values that are stored in attributes with diﬀerent names,
but you still want to use it for the subject pattern, you can edit the variable name to place the corresponding attribute value
in the subject accordingly. For example, provide ${email}, if a SAML assertion uses email instead of providing mail.
When using a subaccount in the Cloud Foundry environment: As of version 2.12.5, the Cloud Connector also oﬀers direct
access to custom variables injected in the JWT (JSON Web token) by SAP BTP Authorization & Trust Management that were
taken over from a SAML assertion.

The values for these variables are provided by the trusted identiy provider in the token which is passed to the Cloud Connector
and speci es the user that has logged on to the cloud application.
By default, the following attributes are provided:

<CN>: (common name) – the name of the certi cate owner
<EMAIL>: (e-mail address) - the e-mail address of the certi cate owner
<L>: (locality) – the certi cate owner's location
<O>: (organization) – the certi cate owner's organization or company
<OU>: (name of organizational unit) – the organizational unit to which the certi cate owner belongs
<ST>: (state of residence) – the state in which the certi cate issuer resides
<C>: (country of residence) – the country in which the certi cate owner resides
<Expiration Tolerance (h)>: The length of time in hours, that an application can use a principal issued for a user after the
token from cloud side has expired.
<Certi cate Validity (min)>: The length of time in minutes, that a certi cate generated for principal propagation can
authenticate against the back end. You can reuse a previously generated certi cate to improve performance.

Sample Certi cate
By choosing Generate Sample Certi cate you can create a sample certi cate that looks like one of the short-lived certi cates
created at runtime. You can use this certi cate to, for example, generate user mapping rules in the target system, via
transaction CERTRULE in an ABAP system. If your subject pattern contains variable elds, a wizard lets you provide meaningful
values for each of them and eventually you can save the sample certi cate in DER format.

Content
Overview
Requirements
Implementation

Overview
The Cloud Connector can use on-the- y generated X.509 user certi cates to log in to on-premise systems if the external user
session is authenticated (for example by means of SAML). If you do not want to use the built-in certi cation authority (CA)
functionality of the Cloud Connector (for example because of security considerations), you can connect SAP SSO 2.0 Secure
Login Server (SLS) or higher.

 Note
Make sure you use a version that is still supported, which is currently at least SAP SSO 3.0 Secure Login Server.

SLS is a Java application running on AS JAVA 7.20 or higher, which provides interfaces for certi cate enrollment.
SLS supports the following formats:
HTTPS
REST

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

85

5/19/2023

JSON
PKCS#10/PKCS#7

 Note
Any enrollment requires a successful user or client authentication, which can be a single, multiple or even a multi factor
authentication.

The following schemes are supported:
LDAP/ADS
RADIUS
SAP SSO OTP
ABAP RFC
Kerberos/SPNego
X.509 TLS Client Authentication
SLS lets you de ne arbitrary enrollment pro les, each with a unique pro le UID in its URL, and with a con gurable
authentication and certi cate generation.

Requirements
For user certi cation, SLS must provide a pro le that adheres to the following:
Cloud Connector client authentication by its X.509 system certi cate
Cloud Connector system certi cate and SLS may live in diﬀerent PKIs
Cloud Connector hands over the full user´s certi cate subject name
With SAP SSO 2.0 SP06, SLS provides the following required features:
TLS Client Authentication-based enrollment with SecureLoginModuleUserDelegationWithSSL (available since
SP04)
multi-PKI support is implemented by all standard components of Application Server (AS) JAVA, AS ABAP, HANA, by

Con gure Kerberos
Context
The Cloud Connector allows you to propagate users authenticated in SAP BTP via Kerberos against backend systems. It uses
the Service For User and Constrained Delegation protocol extension of Kerberos.

 Note
This feature is not supported for ABAP backend systems. In this case, you can use the certi cate-based principal
propagation, see Con gure a CA Certi cate for Principal Propagation.

The Key Distribution Center (KDC) is used for exchanging messages in order to retrieve Kerberos tokens for a certain user and
backend system.
For more information, see Kerberos Protocol Extensions: Service for User and Constrained Delegation Protocol

.

1. An SAP BTP application calls a backend system via the Cloud Connector.
2. The Cloud Connector calls the KDC to obtain a Kerberos token for the user propagated from the Cloud Connector.
3. The obtained Kerberos token is sent as a credential to the backend system.

Procedure
1. Choose Con guration from the main menu.
2. From the Kerberos section of the On Premise tab, choose Edit.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

89

5/19/2023

3. Enter the name of your Kerberos realm.
4. Upload a KEYTAB le that contains the secret keys of your service user. The KEYTAB le should contain the rc4-hmac
key for your user.
5. Enter the name of the service user to be used for communication with the KDC. This user should be allowed to request
Kerberos tokens for other users for the backend systems that you are going to access.
6. In the <KDC Hosts> eld (press Add to display the eld), enter the host name of your KDC using the format <host>:
<port>. The port is optional; if you leave it empty, the default, 88, is used.
7. Choose Save.

Example
You have a backend system protected with SPNego authentication in your corporate network. You want to call it from a cloud
application while preserving the identity of a cloud-authenticated user.
De ne the following:
A connectivity destination in SAP BTP, with ProxyType = OnPremise.
A system mapping made in the Cloud Connector. (Choose Cloud to On Premise from your subaccount menu, Go to tab
Access Control Add , and for Principal Type, select Kerberos.)
Kerberos con guration in the Cloud Connector, where the service user is allowed to delegate calls for your backend host
service.
Result:
When you now call a backend system, the Cloud Connector obtains an SPNego token from your KDC for the cloud-authenticated
user. This token is sent along with the request to the back end, so that it can authenticate the user and the identity to be
preserved.

Export Access Control Settings
1. From your subaccount menu, choose Cloud To On-Premise and select the tab Access Control.
2. To store the current settings in a ZIP le, choose Download icon in the upper-right corner.
3. You can later import this le into a diﬀerent Cloud Connector.

Con gure Access Control (HTTP)
Specify the backend systems that can be accessed by your cloud applications using HTTP.
To allow your cloud applications to access a certain backend system on the intranet via HTTP, you must specify this system in
the Cloud Connector.

 Note
Make sure that also redirect locations are con gured as internal hosts.
If the target server responds with a redirect HTTP status code (30x), the cloud-side HTTP client usually sends the redirect
over the Cloud Connector as well. The Cloud Connector runtime then performs a reverse lookup to rewrite the location
header that indicates where to route the redirected request.
If the redirect location is ambiguous (that is, several mappings point to the same internal host and port), the rst one found
is used. If none is found, the location header stays untouched.

When you are done, choose Next.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

93

5/19/2023

4. Protocol: This eld allows you to decide whether the Cloud Connector should use HTTP or HTTPS for the connection to
the backend system. Note that this is completely independent from the setting on cloud side. Thus, even if the HTTP
destination on cloud side speci es "http://" in its URL, you can select HTTPS. This way, you are ensured that the entire
connection from the cloud application to the actual backend system (provided through the SSL tunnel) is SSL-encrypted.
The only prerequisite is that the backend system supports HTTPS on that port. For more information, see Initial
Con guration (HTTP).
If you specify HTTPS and there is a "system certi cate" imported in the Cloud Connector, the latter attempts to
use that certi cate for performing a client-certi cate-based logon to the backend system.
If there is no system certi cate imported, the Cloud Connector opens an HTTPS connection without client
certi cate.

5. Internal Host and Internal Port specify the actual host and port under which the target system can be reached within the
intranet. It needs to be an existing network address that can be resolved on the intranet and has network visibility for
the Cloud Connector without any proxy. Cloud Connector will try to forward the request to the network address speci ed
by the internal host and port, so this address needs to be real.

6. Virtual Host identi es the host name exactly as speci ed in the <URL> property of the HTTP destination con guration in
SAP BTP.
See: Create HTTP Destinations (Cloud Foundry environment)
The virtual host can be a fake name and does not need to exist. The Virtual Port allows you to distinguish between
diﬀerent entry points of your backend system, for example, HTTP/80 and HTTPS/443, and to have diﬀerent sets of
access control settings for them. For example, some non-critical resources may be accessed by HTTP, while some other
critical resources are to be called using HTTPS only. The elds are prepopulated with the values of the Internal Host and
Internal Port. If you don't modify them, you must provide your internal host and port also in the cloud-side destination
con guration or in the URL used for your favorite HTTP client.

7. Allow Principal Propagation (available as of Cloud Connector 2.15): De nes if any kind of principal propagation should be
allowed over this mapping. If not selected, go to step 9.

8. Principal Type

Procedure for Cloud Connector version 2.15 and higher:
De nes what kind of principal is sent to the backend within the HTTP request. For the principal type X.509

Certificate (if a principal is sent from the cloud side), the principal is injected as an HTTP header
(SSL_CLIENT_CERT) and forwarded to the backend. There, depending on the backed con guration, it can be
used for authentication.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

95

5/19/2023

Procedure for Cloud Connector versions below 2.15:
You can use two diﬀerent variants of an X.509 certi cate to de ne the principal type that is sent to the backend
within the HTTP request: X.509 Certificate (General Usage) or X.509 Certificate (Strict
Usage). The latter was introduced with Cloud Connector 2.11.
If a principal is sent from the cloud side, it is injected in both cases as an HTTP header (SSL_CLIENT_CERT) and
forwarded to the backend. If the backend is con gured correctly for principal propagation, this certi cate can be
used for authentication.
However, if the cloud side does not send a principal, the variants behave diﬀerently:

General Usage (as well as <Principal Type> = None) allows to alternatively use the system certi cate for
the TLS handshake (actually used for trust) also for authentication.

Strict Usage does not allow this. In this case, another authentication type (speci ed in an additional
header) is used instead, for example, basic authentication.
This setting also applies to HTTP authentication types other than principal propagation.

 Note
The recommended variant is X.509 Certificate (Strict Usage) as this lets you use principal
propagation and, for example, basic authentication over the same access control entry, regardless of the
logon order settings in the target system.
To prevent the use of principal propagation to the target system, choose None as <Principal Type>. In this case,
no principal is injected.
For more information on principal propagation, see Con guring Principal Propagation.
9. System Certi cate for Logon (available as of Cloud Connector 2.15): Speci es if the Cloud Connector's system
certi cate should be used for authentication at the backend, if
a. No principal is received, or
b. Principal propagation is not allowed over this mapping at all.
If activated, the system certi cate of the TLS handshake used for trust is also used for authentication.
If not activated, an additional HTTP header (SSL_CLIENT_CERT) is sent. It indicates to the target system that the
system certi cate used for trust must not be used for authentication.
While unselected, another authentication method is used, for example, basic authentication.

 Note
We recommend that you keep this option deactivated, as this lets you use principal propagation and basic
authentication over the same access control entry, regardless of the logon order settings in the target system.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

96

5/19/2023

10. Host In Request Header lets you de ne, which host is used in the host header that is sent to the target server. By
choosing Use Internal Host, the actual host name is used. When choosing Use Virtual Host, the virtual host is
used. In the rst case, the virtual host is still sent via the X-Forwarded-Host header.

11. You can enter an optional description at this stage. The respective description will be shown when pressing the Info
button of the access control entry (table Mapping Virtual to Internal System).

12. The summary shows information about the system to be stored and when saving the host mapping, you can trigger a
ping from the Cloud Connector to the internal host, using the Check availability of internal host checkbox. This allows
you to make sure the Cloud Connector can indeed access the internal system, and allows you to catch basic things, such
as spelling mistakes or rewall problems between the Cloud Connector and the internal host.
If the ping to the internal host is successful (that is, the host is reachable via TLS), the state Reachable is shown. If it
fails, a warning pops up. You can view issue details by choosing the Details button, or check them in the log les.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

97

5/19/2023

This check also tries to perform client authentication if possible, regardless of the host's availability. Find additional
information and hints by choosing the Details button. You can check, for example, if the system certi cate acting as a
client certi cate is con gured correctly, and if the ABAP backend trusts it.
You can execute the availability check for all selected systems in the Access Control overview by pressing the button
(Check availability...) in column Actions.

13. Optional: You can later edit such a system mapping (via Edit) to make the Cloud Connector route the requests for
sales-system.cloud:443 to a diﬀerent backend system. This can be useful if the system is currently down and there
is a back-up system that can serve these requests in the meantime. However, you cannot edit the virtual name of this
system mapping. If you want to use a diﬀerent ctional host name in your cloud application, you must delete the
mapping and create a new one.

Back to Tasks

Limit the Accessible Services for HTTP(S)
In addition to allowing access to a particular host and port, you also must specify which URL paths (Resources) are allowed to
be invoked on that host. The Cloud Connector uses very strict allowlists for its access control. Only those URLs for which you
explicitly granted access are allowed. All other HTTP(S) requests are denied by the Cloud Connector.
To de ne the permitted URLs for a particular backend system, choose the line corresponding to that backend system and
choose Add in section Resources Accessible On... below. A dialog appears prompting you to enter the speci c URL path that you
want to allow to be invoked.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

98

5/19/2023

The Cloud Connector checks that the path part of the URL (up to but not including a possible question mark (?) that may
denote the start of optional CGI-style query parameters) is exactly as speci ed in the con guration. If it is not, the request is
denied. If you select option Path and all sub-paths, the Cloud Connector allows all requests for which the URL path (not
considering any query parameters) starts with the speci ed string.
The Active checkbox lets you specify, if that resource is initially enabled or disabled. See the section below for more information
on enabled and disabled resources.
The WebSocket Upgrade checkbox lets you specify, whether that resource allows a protocol upgrade.
Back to Tasks

Activate or Suspend Resources
In some cases, it is useful for testing purposes to temporarily disable certain resources without having to delete them from the
con guration. This allows you to easily reprovide access to these resources at a later point of time without having to type in
everything once again.
To suspend a resource, select it and choose the Suspend button:
The status icon turns red, and from now on, the Cloud Connector will deny all requests coming in for this resource.

To activate the resource again, select it and choose the Activate button.
By choosing Allow WebSocket upgrade/Disallow WebSocket upgrade this is possible for the protocol upgrade setting as
well.
It is also possible to mark multiple lines and then suspend or activate all of them in one go by clicking the
Activate/Suspend icons in the top row. The same is true for the corresponding Allow WebSocket upgrade/Disallow
WebSocket icons.

Examples:
/production/accounting and Path only (sub-paths are excluded) are selected. Only requests of the form GET
/production/accounting or GET /production/accounting?name1=value1&name2=value2... are
allowed. (GET can also be replaced by POST, PUT, DELETE, and so on.)
/production/accounting and Path and all sub-paths are selected. All requests of the form GET
/production/accounting-plus-some-more-stuff-here?name1=value1... are allowed.
/ and Path and all sub-paths are selected. All requests to this server are allowed.

4. Choose Next.
5. Protocol: Choose RFC or RFC SNC for connecting to the backend system.

 Note
The value RFC SNC is independent from your settings on the cloud side, since it only speci es the communication
beween Cloud Connector and backend system. Using RFC SNC, you can ensure that the entire connection from the
cloud application to the actual backend system (provided by the SSL tunnel) is secured, partly with SSL and partly
with SNC. For more information, see Initial Con guration (RFC).

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

100

5/19/2023

 Note
The back end must be properly con gured to support SNC connections.
SNC con guration must be provided in the Cloud Connector.
6. Choose Next.
7. Choose whether you want to con gure a load balancing logon or connect to a speci c application server.

8. Specify the parameters of the backend system. It needs to be an existing network address that can be resolved on the
intranet and has network visibility for the Cloud Connector. If this is only possible using a valid SAProuter, specify the
router in the respective eld. The Cloud Connector will try to establish a connection to this system, so the address has to
be real.
When using a load-balancing con guration, the Message Server speci es the message server of the ABAP
system. The system ID is a three-char identi er that is also found in the SAP Logon con guration. Alternatively,
it's possible to directly specify the message server port in the System ID eld.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

101

5/19/2023

When using direct logon, the Application Server speci es one application server of the ABAP system. The
instance number is a two-digit number that is also found in the SAP Logon con guration. Alternatively, it's
possible to directly specify the gateway port in the Instance Number eld.

9. Optional: You can virtualize the system information in case you like to hide your internal host names from the cloud. The
virtual information can be a fake name which does not need to exist. The elds will be pre-populated with the values of
the con guration provided in Message Server and System ID, or Application Server and Instance Number.

Virtual Message Server - speci es the host name exactly as speci ed as the jco.client.mshost property in
the RFC destination con guration in the cloud. The Virtual System ID allows you to distinguish between diﬀerent
entry points of your backend system that have diﬀerent sets of access control settings. The value needs to be the
same like for the jco.client.r3name property in the RFC destination con guration in the cloud.
Virtual Application Server - it speci es the host name exactly as speci ed as the jco.client.ashost property
in the RFC destination con guration in the cloud. The Virtual Instance Number allows you to distinguish between
diﬀerent entry points of your backend system that have diﬀerent sets of access control settings. The value needs
to be the same like for the jco.client.sysnr property in the RFC destination con guration in the cloud.
10. This step is only relevant if you have chosen RFC SNC. The <Principal Type> eld de nes what kind of principal is used
when con guring a destination on the cloud side using this system mapping with authentication type Principal
Propagation. No matter what you choose, make sure that the general con guration for the <Principal Type> has been
done to make it work correctly. For destinations using diﬀerent authentication types, this setting is ignored. In case you
choose None as <Principal Type>, it is not possible to apply principal propagation to this system.

 Note
If you use an RFC connection, you cannot choose between diﬀerent principal types. Only the X.509 certi cate is
supported. You need an SNC-enabled backend connection to use it.

11. SNC Partner Name: This step will only come up if you have chosen RFC SNC. The SNC partner name needs to contain
the correct SNC identi cation of the target system.

12. Mapping Virtual to Internal System: You can enter an optional description at this stage. The respective description will
be shown as a rich tooltip when the mouse hovers over the entries of the virtual host column (table ).

13. The summary shows information about the system to be stored. When saving the system mapping, you can trigger a
ping from the Cloud Connector to the internal host, using the Check Internal Host checkbox. This allows you to make

there is a back-up system that can serve these requests in the meantime. However, you cannot edit the virtual name of
this system mapping. If you want to use a diﬀerent ctional host name in your cloud application, you must delete the
mapping and create a new one. Here, you can also change the Principal Type to None in case you don't want to allow
principal propagation to a certain system.

15. Optional. You can later edit a system mapping to add more protection to your system when using RFC via theCloud

To allow your cloud applications to access a certain backend system on the intranet via TCP, insert a new entry in the Cloud
Connector access control management.
1. Choose Cloud To On-Premise from your Subaccount menu.
2. Choose Add (+). A wizard opens and asks for the required values.
3. Backend Type: Select an appropriate system type, for example, Non-SAP System, from the drop-down list. When you
are done, choose Next.

4. Protocol: Select TCP or TCP SSL for the connection to the backend system. When choosing TCP, you can perform an
end-to-end TLS handshake from the cloud client to the backend. If the cloud-side client is using plain communication, but
you still need to encrypt the hop between Cloud Connector and the backend, choose TCP SSL. When you are done,
choose Next.

 Note
When selecting TCP as protocol, the following warning message is displayed:

TCP connections can pose a security risk by permitting unmonitored traffic. Ensure
only trustworthy applications have access
. The reason is that using plain TCP, the Cloud Connector cannot see or log any detail information about the calls.

take the recommended security measures for your SAP BTP (sub)account. See section Security in the SAP
BTP documentation.

5. Internal Host and Port or Port Range: specify the host and port under which the target system can be reached within the
intranet. It needs to be an existing network address that can be resolved on the intranet and has network visibility for
the Cloud Connector. The Cloud Connector will try to forward the request to the network address speci ed by the
internal host and port. That is why this address needs to be real.

For TCP and TCP SSL, you can also specify a port range through its lower and upper limit, separated by a hyphen.

6. Enter a Virtual Host and Virtual Port. The virtual host can be a fake name and does not need to exist. The elds are
prepopulated with the values of the Internal Host and Port or Port Range.

Map Systems and Limit Access
Initially, after installing a new Cloud Connector, no network systems or resources are exposed to the cloud. You must con gure
each system and resource used by applications of the connected cloud subaccount. To do this, choose Cloud To On Premise from
your subaccount menu and go to tab Access Control:

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

111

5/19/2023

The Cloud Connector supports any type of system (SAP or non-SAP system) that can be called via one of the supported
protocols. For example, a convenient way to access an ABAP system from a cloud application is via SAP NetWeaver Gateway, as
it allows the consumption of ABAP content via HTTP and open standards.
For systems using HTTP communication, see: Con gure Access Control (HTTP).
For information on con guring RFC resources, see: Con gure Access Control (RFC).
We recommend that you limit the access to backend services and resources. Instead of con guring a system and granting
access to all its resources, grant access only to the resources needed by the cloud application. For example, de ne access to an
HTTP service by specifying the service URL root path and allowing access to all its subpaths.
When con guring an on-premise system, you can de ne a virtual host and port for the speci ed system. The virtual host name
and port represent the fully quali ed domain name of the related system in the cloud. We recommend that you use the virtual
host name/port mapping to prevent leaking information about a system's physical machine name and port to the cloud.

shadow instance to take over the master role, and then takes the shadow role itself.

 Tip
Encoded Resource ID
URI paths may contain the resource ID in order to identify the resource to be edited or deleted. A resource ID, however, may
contain characters such as the forward slash that collide with the path separator of the URI and hence require an escape
mechanism. We adopted the following simple escape or encoding method for a resource ID:
1. Replace all occurrences of character '+' with '+2B'.
2. Replace all occurrences of character '-' with '+2D'.
3. Replace all occurrences of character '/' with '-'.

Examples
Find examples on how to use the Cloud Connector's con guration REST APIs.

Concept
The sample code in this section (download zip le) demonstrates how to use the REST APIs provided by Cloud Connector to
perform various con guration tasks.
Starting with a freshly installed Cloud Connector, the samples include initial con guration of the Cloud Connector instance,
connectivity setup, high availability con guration, and common tasks like backup/restore operations, as well as integration with
solution management.
The examples are implemented in Kotlin, a simple Java VM-based language. However, even if you are using a diﬀerent language,
they still show the basic use of the APIs and their parameters for speci c con guration purposes.
If you are not familiar with Kotlin, nd a brief introduction and some typical statements below.
REST API Parameters
REST API Invocation
How To Use the Examples

REST API Parameters
In almost all requests and responses, structures are encoded in JSON format. To describe the parameter details, we use Kotlin
data classes.
This class represents a structure that you can use as value in a request or response:
data class OnlyPropertiesNamesAreRelevant(
val user: String,
val password: String
)

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

198

5/19/2023

The JSON representation for that class is
{"user":<userValue>, "password":<passwordValue>}

Encoded in Kotlin this string looks like
"""{"user":"$userValue", "password":"$passwordValue"}"""

or as an object:
val credentials = OnlyPropertiesNamesAreRelevant(userValue, passwordValue)

Back to Concept

REST API Invocation
(a)

Fuel.put(url)

(b)

.header("Connection", "close")

(c)

.authentication().basic(user, password)

(d)

.jsonBody(credentials)

(e)

.responseObject<OnlyPropertiesNamesAreRelevant> { _, _, result ->
when (result) {

(f)

is Result.Failure -> processRequestError(result.error)
is Result.Success -> println("returned: ${result.get()}")
}
}
.join()
(a) - Fuel is an HTTP framework used in the examples. Important is the verb after Fuel - it is the REST API method.
(b) - Adds a request header Connection: close, which forces a connection close after request. In the examples, this
header is de ned on FuelManager for all calls.
(c) - Basic authentication is used for the call with user and password.
(d) - HTTP requests with parameters require mostly JSON. The jsonBody-method adds the header Content-Type:

application/json and serializes the provided object credentials to JSON. Requests without body like DELETE or GET
omit body methods.
(e) - The responseObject<ClassType>-method adds the header Accept: application/json and de-serializes
the response to the speci ed class type. Some APIs do not have any response or non-JSON response. In such cases, the
method response is used instead of responseObject<ClassType>.
(f) - The way, how Kotlin decides between success (2xx) and failed responses. For details on the possible response status,
see Con guration REST APIs.

How To Use the Examples
Some common details, used by diﬀerent examples, were extracted to the scenario.json con guration le. This lets you use
meaningful names like config.master!!.user in the examples. The le is loaded by

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

5/19/2023

val config = loadScenarioConfiguration()

Each example also invokes

disableTrustChecks()

This method disables all SSL-related checks.

 Caution
disableTrustChecks() is only used for test purposes. Do not use it in a productive environment.

Both methods, as well as some common REST API parameter structures (data classes) are de ned in the le Scenario
Con guration. This is the only help class under sources/.
When using the examples, start with Initial Con guration.
Prerequisite is a freshly installed Cloud Connector.
After a mandatory password change and de ning the high availability role of the Cloud Connector instance (master or shadow),
the example demonstrates how to provide a description for the instance and how to set up the UI and system certi cates.
Once the initial con guration is done, you can optionally proceed with these steps:
Connect to your subaccount on BTP (Subaccount Con guration)
Create or restore a con guration backup (Backup And Restore Con guration)
Con gure and connect high availability instances (High Availability Settings)
Integrate the Cloud Connector with the solution management infrastructure (Solution Management Integration)

Using Service Channels
Con gure Cloud Connector service channels to connect your on-premise network to speci c services on SAP BTP.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

214

5/19/2023

Context
Cloud Connector service channels provide access from an external network to certain services on SAP BTP. The called services
are not exposed to direct access from the Internet. The Cloud Connector ensures that the connection is always available and
communication is secured.
Service Channel Type

Description

SAP HANA Database on SAP BTP

The service channel for the SAP HANA Database lets you access
SAP HANA databases that run in the Cloud from database clients
(for example, clients using ODBC/JDBC drivers). You can use the
service channel to connect database, analytical, BI, or replication
tools to your SAP HANA database in your SAP BTP subaccount.

RFC Connection to SAP BTP ABAP environment

The service channel for RFC supports calls from on-premise
systems to the SAP BTP ABAP environment using RFC.

K8s Cluster (TCP connection to a SAP BTP Kubernetes cluster)

Service channel to establish a connection to a service in a
Kubernetes cluster on SAP BTP.

Con gure a Service Channel for an SAP HANA Database
Using Cloud Connector service channels, you can establish a connection to an SAP HANA database in SAP BTP that is not
directly exposed to external access.

Context
The service channel for SAP HANA Database lets you access SAP HANA databases running in the cloud via ODBC/JDBC. You
can use the service channel to connect database, analytical, BI, or replication tools to an SAP HANA database in your SAP BTP
subaccount.
Restrictions
This feature is only available in regions (data centers) that provide the SAP HANA service (that is, SAP data centers (Neo environment),
Azure and AWS).
For more information, see SAP HANA Service for SAP BTP Getting Started Guide.
In AWS regions, you can currently use the service channel only for the SAP HANA service provisioned before June 4, 2018 (old
version).

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

215

5/19/2023

If you are using the SAP HANA service provisioned after June 4, 2018 (new version, available on AWS and Google Cloud) or the

SAP HANA Cloud service, you can currently access SAP HANA databases only directly, without going through the Cloud
Connector.
For more information, see Connecting to an SAP HANA Service Instance Directly from SAP HANA Clients.
To nd detailed information for a speci c Cloud Foundry region and SAP HANA service version, see Find the Right Guide.

 Note
The following procedure requires a productive SAP HANA instance that is available in the same subaccount. You cannot
access an SAP HANA instance that is owned by a diﬀerent subaccount within the same or another global account (shared
SAP HANA database). See also Sharing Databases with Other Subaccounts.

Procedure
1. From your subaccount menu, choose On-Premise To Cloud.
2. Choose Add (+).

3. In the Add Service Channel dialog, leave the default value HANA Database in the <Type> eld.
4. Optionally, provide a Description that explains what the HANA DB service channel is used for.
5. Choose Next.
6. Choose the SAP HANA instance name. If you cannot select it from the drop-down list, enter the instance name manually.
In the Neo environment, it must match one of the names (IDs) shown in the cockpit under SAP HANA/SAP ASE
Databases & Schemas , in the <DB/Schema ID> column.

 Note
The SAP HANA instance name is case-sensitive.
In the Cloud Foundry environment, the format of the SAP HANA instance name includes the Cloud Foundry space name,
the database name and the database ID.
Example:

test:testInstance:3fcc976d-457a-474e-975b-e572600f474e:de19c262-a1fc-4096-bfce-1c41388e4b49

7. Specify the local instance number. This is a double-digit number which computes the local port used to access the SAP
HANA instance in the cloud. The local port is derived from the local instance number as 3<instance number>15. For
example, if the instance number is 22, then the local port is 32215. The local instance number must not be 00. This
instance number might cause problems with some SAP HANA clients.
8. Specify the number of physical connections to SAP BTP. The default value is 1. One physical connection can open various
virtual connections through multiplexing.

9. Leave Enabled selected to establish the channel immediately after clicking Finish, or unselect it if you don't want to
establish the channel immediately.
10. Choose Finish.

Next Steps
Once you have established an SAP HANA Database service channel, you can connect on-premise database or BI tools to the
selected SAP HANA database in the cloud. This can be done by using <cloud_connector_host>:<local_HANA_port> in
the JDBC/ODBC connect strings.
See Connect DB Tools to SAP HANA via Service Channels.

Connect DB Tools to SAP HANA via Service Channels
Context
You can connect database, BI, or replication tools running in on-premise network to an SAP HANA database on SAP BTP using
service channels of the Cloud Connector. You can also use the high availability support of the Cloud Connector on a database
connection. The picture below shows the landscape in such a scenario.

This link points to the latest release of SAP HANA Administration Guide. Refer to the SAP BTP Release Notes

to

nd out which SAP HANA SPS is supported by SAP BTP. Find the list of guides for earlier releases in the Related Links
section below.

Procedure
1. To establish a highly available connection to one or multiple SAP HANA instances in the cloud, we recommend that you
make use of the failover support of the Cloud Connector. Set up a master and a shadow instance. See Install a Failover
Instance for High Availability.
2. In the master instance, con gure a service channel to the SAP HANA database of the SAP BTP subaccount to which you
want to connect. If, for example, the chosen HANA instance is 01, the port of the service channel is 30115. See also
Con gure a Service Channel for an SAP HANA Database.
3. Connect on-premise DB tools via JDBC to the SAP HANA database by using the following connection string:
Example:
jdbc:sap://<cloud-connector-master-host>:30115;<cloud-connector-shadow-host>:30115[/?<options>
The SAP HANA JDBC driver supports failover out of the box. All you need is to con gure the shadow instance of the
Cloud Connector as a failover server in the JDBC connection string. The diﬀerent options supported in the JDBC
connection string are described in: Connect to SAP HANA via JDBC
4. You can also connect on-premise DB tools via ODBC to the SAP HANA database. Use the following connection string:
"DRIVER=HDBODBC32;UID=<user>;PWD=<password>;SERVERNODE=<cloud-connector-master-host>:30115,<cl

Tasks
Trust Cloud Applications in the Cloud Connector
Con gure the Trust Store

Trust Cloud Applications in the Cloud Connector
 Restriction
Currently, the complete implementation of this feature is available only for interaction with the Neo environment.

By default, all applications within a subaccount are allowed to use the Cloud Connector associated with the subaccount they run
in. However, this behavior might not be desired in speci c scenarios. For example, this may be acceptable for some applications,
as they must interact with on-premise resources, while other applications, for which it is not transparent whether they try to
receive on-premise data, might turn out to be malicious. For such cases, you can use an application allowlist.

As long as there is no entry in this list, all applications are allowed to use the Cloud Connector. If one or more entries appear in
the allowlist, then only these applications are allowed to connect to the exposed systems in the Cloud Connector.
You can add, edit, or delete entries as follows:
1. From your subaccount menu, choose Cloud to On-Premise and go to the Applications tab.
2. To add an application, choose the Add icon in section Trusted Applications.
3. Enter the <Application Name> in the Add Trusted Application dialog.

 Note
To add all applications that are listed in section Tunnel Connection Limits on the same screen, you can also use the
Upload button next to the Add button. The list Tunnel Connection Limits shows all applications for which a speci c
maximal number of tunnel connections was speci ed. See also: Con gure Advanced Connectivity.
4. (Optional) Enter the maximal number of <Tunnel Connections> only if you want to override the default value.
5. Choose Save.

The application name is visible in the SAP BTP cockpit under

Applications

Java Applications . To allow a

subscribed application, you must add it to the allowlist in the format <providerSubaccount>:

is required.

To edit an existing entry:
1. Choose the Edit button.
2. When you are done, select Save.

1. Select the entry.
2. Choose Delete.
To delete all entries, choose Delete All.
To add all applications from section Tunnel Connection Limits to the allowlist, choose the button Add all applications... from
section Trusted Applications.

Back to Tasks

Con gure the Trust Store (as of Version 2.15)
To con gure the trust store, choose Con guration from the main menu, and go to tab On Premise, section Trust Store.
By default, the Cloud Connector does not trust any on-premise system when connecting to it via TLS:

To enable secured backend communication, you must add trusted certi cate authorities (CAs) to the allowlist. Any TLS server
certi cate that has been issued by one of those CAs, will be considered trusted. If the CA that has issued a concrete server
certi cate is not contained in the trust store, the server will be considered untrusted and the connection will fail.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

224

5/19/2023

 Note
You must provide the CA's X.509 certi cates in DER or PEM format.

 Caution
If you don't want to specify explicit CAs you are going to trust, but rather trust all backends, you can switch oﬀ the handle. In
this case, the allowlist is ignored. This option considered less secure, since all backends are trusted now.

Back to Tasks

Con gure Domain Mappings for Cookies
Context
Some HTTP servers return cookies that contain a domain attribute. For subsequent requests, HTTP clients should send these
cookies to machines that have host names in the speci ed domain.
For example, if the client receives a cookie like the following:
Set-Cookie: cookie-field=some-value; domain=mycompany.corp; path=...; ...
It returns the cookie in follow-up requests to all hosts like ecc60.mycompany.corp, crm40.mycompany.corp, and so on, if
the other attributes like path and attribute require it.
However, in a Cloud Connector setup between a client and a Web server, this may lead to problems. For example, assume that
you have de ned a virtual host sales-system.cloud and mapped it to the internal host name ecc60.mycompany.corp. The
client "thinks" it is sending an HTTP request to the host name sales-system.cloud, while the Web server, unaware of the above
host name mapping, sets a cookie for the domain mycompany.corp. The client does not know this domain name and thus, for
the next request to that Web server, doesn't attach the cookie, which it should do. The procedure below prevents this problem.

Procedure
1. From your subaccount menu, choose Cloud To On-Premise, and go to the Cookie Domains tab.
2. Choose Add.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

225

5/19/2023

3. Enter cloud as the virtual domain, and your company name as the internal domain.
4. Choose Save.

The Cloud Connector checks the Web server's response for Set-Cookie headers. If it nds one with an attribute

domain=intranet.corp, it replaces it with domain=sales.cloud before returning the HTTP response to the client.
Then, the client recognizes the domain name, and for the next request against www1.sales.cloud it attaches the cookie,
which then successfully arrives at the server on machine1.intranet.corp.

 Note
Some Web servers use a syntax such as domain=.intranet.corp (RFC 2109), even though the newer RFC 6265
recommends using the notation without a dot.

 Note
The value of the domain attribute may be a simple host name, in which case no extra domain mapping is necessary on
the Cloud Connector. If the server sets a cookie with domain=machine1.intranet.corp, the Cloud Connector
automatically reverses the mapping machine1.intranet.corp to www1.sales.cloud and replaces the cookie
domain accordingly.

Con guration Backup
You can backup and restore your Cloud Connector con guration.
To backup or restore your Cloud Connector con guration, do the following:
1. From the Cloud Connector main menu, choose Connector.

2. To backup or restore your con guration, choose the respective icon in the upper right corner of the screen.
a. To backup your con guration, enter and repeat a password in the Backup dialog and choose Backup.

 Note
An archive containing a snapshot of the current Cloud Connector con guration is created and downloaded by
your browser. For security reasons, some les are encrypted, using the password provided for the backup
procedure.

 Tip
You can use this archive to restore the current state of the same installation or to move the current
con guration to a new Cloud Connector installation, if the original instance can no longer be used.
You can restore the archive on a Cloud Connector instance
With the same or higher version than the original one.
Running on a diﬀerent operating system.
However, you cannot restore it on an older Cloud Connector version.

b. To restore your con guration, enter the required Archive Password and the Login Password of the currently
logged-in administrator user in the Restore from Archive dialog and choose Restore.

 Caution
The restore action overwrites the current con guration of the Cloud Connector. Its current state and settings
will be lost permanently unless you have created another backup before doing the restore operation. Upon
successfully restoring the con guration backup, the Cloud Connector restarts automatically. All active
sessions are then terminated.

 Note
The props.ini le is treated in a special way. If the le from the backup archive diﬀers from the one
that is used in the current installation, it will be placed next to the original one as

props.ini.restored. If you want to use the props.ini.restored le, replace the existing
props.ini le by the restored one on OS level and restart the Cloud Connector afterwards.
All custom path settings from the con guration backup archive, which are not valid or operable
anymore, will be automatically reset to their respective default values upon restore operation. For
example, this will be the case if a con gured directory or le path from the backup archive does not
exist or is not accessible anymore.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

231

5/19/2023

Restored certi cates from older backup archives might have expired and must be replaced with valid
ones to get all con gured scenarios to work again.
If restoring a con guration backup archive on a host that is diﬀerent from the original one, the restored
UI certi cate might not be issued for the new hostname, domain or IP address, and therefore would
require a replacement with a matching UI server certi cate as well.
If you are using an external SNC library, neither the library itself is part of the con guration backup
archive, nor any con guration that this library would load from its own external storage. As a result, the
SNC con guration must be set up again after restoring a con guration backup archive on a diﬀerent
host.
The same applies to used own CA certi cates which are stored in the JVM's managed trust store, for
example, if Email alerting or LDAP has been set up this way, with own certi cates for establishing a
secure communication. These externally stored CA certi cates would also not be part of the
con guration backup archive and must be imported into the local JVM's trust store manually.

 Caution
Do not run multiple Cloud Connector instances with the same con guration simultaneously. The feature to
restore a con guration backup archive on another Cloud Connector installation is not supposed to be used for
cloning purposes, but only for supporting the move of a Cloud Connector instance from one host to another.
After restoring a con guration backup archive on a diﬀerent Cloud Connector installation, you must stop the
original Cloud Connector instance immediately. Otherwise, running two or more instances with the same
con guration will cause issues. Such a cloned setup is not supported.

Con gure Login Screen Information
Add additional information to the login screen and con gure its appearance.
To con gure the login screen information, proceed as follows:
1. Go to

Con guration

User Interface

and press the Edit button in section Login Screen Information.

As a result, the following dialog is opened:

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

232

5/19/2023

2. In section Display Policy, select a display policy for the login screen information.
3. In section Display Properties, specify your preferred display properties (appearance and position):
The login information is displayed in a box with rounded corners. You can specify its width and height in pixels (unit

px) or as a percentage (unit %).

 Note
Omitting any value triggers the default or auto behavior.
For the width, the default behavior is equivalent to 100%.
For the height, the default behavior sets the height to a value that accommodates the login
information (that is, the given HTML fragment). For extensive information we therefore recommend
that you limit the height to a suitable pixel or percentage value to induce scrolling, and to prevent the
box from growing beyond a reasonable height.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

233

5/19/2023

When customizing the background color of the box, the opacity (of the background color), font color, or text
alignment, then the section Login Information automatically switches to preview mode. That way you can follow
live the changes made to the appearance of the box and of the information displayed inside it.

 Note
You can hide the box and to show only the text of the login information by choosing an opacity value of 0
(opacity is the opposite of transparency. No opacity means complete transparency).
You can position the box containing the login information at the top or bottom of the login page. To do this, set the
eld <Position> to the corresponding pixel or percentage value.
4. Enter the information to be displayed in section Login Information. The information must be supplied as an HTML
fragment. There is a limited number of tags that can be used. Attributes available for these tags are subject to
restrictions.

with your own one to let the browser accept the certi cate without security warnings.

Procedure
Master Instance
1. From the main menu, choose Con guration and go to the User Interface tab.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

235

5/19/2023

2. In the UI Certi cate section, start a certi cate signing request procedure by choosing the icon Generate a Certi cate
Signing Request.
3. In the pop-up Generate CSR, specify a key size and a subject tting to your host name.
For host matching, you should use the available names within the subjectAlternativeName (SAN) extension, see
RFC 2818

and https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/4981025180483584

. A check veri es whether the host

matches one of the entries in the SAN extension.
In section Subject Alternative Names, you can add additional values by pressing the Add button. Choose one or more of
the following SAN types and provide the matching values:
DNS: a speci c host name (for example, www.sap.com) or a wildcard hostname (for example, *.sap.com).
IP: an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
RFC822

: an example for this type of value is a simple email address: for example, donotreply@sap.com.

URI: a URI for which the certi cate should be valid.

4. Press Generate.
5. You are prompted to save the signing request in a le. The content of the le is the signing request in PEM format.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

236

5/19/2023

The signing request must be provided to a Certi cate Authority (CA) - either one within your company or another one
you trust. The CA signs the request and the returned response should be stored in a le.

 Note
The response should be either an X.509 certi cate or a PKCS#7 in PEM format.
6. To import the signing response, choose the Upload icon.

As of Cloud Connector version 2.13, you can also upload an existing PKCS#12 certi cate directly (instead of generating a
CSR).

7. Select Browse to locate the le and then choose the Import button.
8. Review the certi cate details that are displayed.
9. Restart the Cloud Connector to activate the new certi cate.

Shadow Instance
In a High Availability setup, perform the same operation on the shadow instance.

 Caution
UI certi cates are used for the secure communication between master and shadow instances. Replacing the UI certi cate
breaks the trust relationship and communication between master and shadow is not possible anymore.
Please disconnect the shadow instance when you are going to replace UI certi cate(s). Once the certi cate update is done,
connect the shadow instance again. You will be forced to enter user and password again to establish the trust relationship
between master and shadow instances.

Con gure Named Cloud Connector Users
Set up LDAP-based user management for the Cloud Connector.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

237

5/19/2023

LDAP-Based User Management
We recommend that you con gure LDAP-based user management for the Cloud Connector to allow only named administrator
users to log on to the administration UI.
This guarantees traceability of the Cloud Connector con guration changes via the Cloud Connector audit log. If you use the
default and built-in Administrator user, you cannot identify the actual person or persons who perform con guration
changes. Also, you will not be able to use diﬀerent types of user groups.

Con guration
If you have an LDAP server in your landscape, you can con gure the Cloud Connector to authenticate Cloud Connector users
against the LDAP server.
Valid users or user groups must be assigned to one of the following roles:
Administrator users: admin or sccadmin
Display users: sccdisplay or sccmonitoring

 Note
The role sccmonitoring provides access to the monitoring APIs, and is particularly used by the SAP Solution
Manager infrastructure, see Monitoring APIs.
Support users: sccsupport
Alternatively, you can de ne custom role names for each of these user groups, see: Use LDAP for Authentication.
Once con gured, the default Cloud Connector Administrator user becomes inactive and can no longer be used to log on to
the Cloud Connector.

Use LDAP for Authentication
You can use LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) to con gure Cloud Connector authentication.
After installation, the Cloud Connector uses le-based user management by default. Alternatively, the Cloud Connector also
supports LDAP-based user management. If you operate an LDAP server in your landscape, you can con gure the Cloud
Connector to use the LDAP user base.
If LDAP authentication is active, you can assign users or user groups to the following default roles:
User Role

Authorization

sccadmin or admin

Administrate the Cloud Connector (all CRUD operations).

sccsubadmin

Manage all subaccount-related settings.
Perform support-related tasks like setting trace levels or
creating a thread dump.
Access to common settings for all subaccounts, like system
certi cate settings, is permitted.

sccdisplay

Access the Cloud Connector administration UI in read-only mode.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

238

5/19/2023

User Role

sccsupport

Authorization
Access the Cloud Connector administration UI in read-only
mode.
Perform support-related tasks like setting trace levels or
creating a thread dump.

sccmonitoring

Provides access to the monitoring APIs, and is particularly used by
the SAP Solution Manager infrastructure, see Monitoring APIs.

Group membership is checked by the Cloud Connector.

Setting LDAP Authentication
1. From the main menu, choose Con guration and go to the User Interface tab.
2. From the Authentication section, choose Switch to LDAP.

3. (Optional) To save intermediate adoptions of the LDAP con guration, choose Save Draft. This lets you store the changes
in the Cloud Connector without activation.
4. Usually, the LDAP server lists users in an LDAP node and user groups in another node. In this case, you can use the
following template for LDAP con guration. Copy the template into the con guration text area:
roleBase="ou=groups,dc=scc"
roleName="cn"
roleSearch="(uniqueMember={0})"
userBase="ou=users,dc=scc"
userSearch="(uid={0})"
Change the <ou> and <dc> elds in userBase and roleBase , according to the con guration on your LDAP server, or use
some other LDAP query.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

239

5/19/2023

 Note
The con guration depends on your speci c LDAP server. For details, contact your LDAP administrator.
5. Provide the LDAP server's host and port (port 389 is used by default) in the <Host> eld. To use the secure protocol
variant LDAPS based on TLS, select Secure.
6. Provide a failover LDAP server's host and port (port 389 is used by default) in the <Alternate Host> eld. To use the
secure protocol variant LDAPS based on TLS, select <Secure Alternate Host>.
7. (Optional) Depending on your LDAP server con guration you may need to specify the <Connection User Name> and its

<Connection Password>. LDAP Servers supporting anonymous binding ignore these parameters.
8. (Optional) To use your own role names, you can customize the default role names in the Custom Roles section. If no
custom role is provided, the Cloud Connector checks permissions for the corresponding default role name:

<Administrator Role> (default: sccadmin)
<Support Role> (default: sccsupport)
<Display Role> (default: sccdisplay)
<Monitoring Role> (default: sccmonitoring)
9. (Optional) Before activating the LDAP authentication, you can execute an authentication test by choosing the Test LDAP
Con guration button. In the pop-up dialog, you must specify user name and password of a user who is allowed to logon
after activating the con guration. The check veri es if authentication would be successful or not.

 Note
We strongly recommend that you perform an authentication test. If authentication should fail, login is not possible
anymore. The test dialog also provides a test protocol, which could be helpful for troubleshooting.
For more information about how to set up LDAP authentication, see tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/realmhowto.html

.

 Note
To nd a list of all supported attributes, see https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5doc/con g/realm.html#JNDI_Directory_Realm_-_org.apache.catalina.realm.JNDIRealm

.

You can also con gure LDAP authentication on the shadow instance in a high availability setup (master and shadow).
From the main menu of the shadow instance, select Shadow Con guration, go to tab User Interface, and check the
Authentication section.

 Note
If you are using LDAP together with a high availability setup, you cannot use the con guration option userPattern.
Instead, use a combination of userSearch, userSubtree and userBase .

 Caution
An LDAP connection over SSL/TLS can cause SSL errors if the LDAP server uses a certi cate that is not signed by a
trusted CA. If you cannot use a certi cate signed by a trusted CA, you must set up the trust relationship manually,
that is, import the public part of the issuer certi cate to the JDK's trust storage.
Usually, the cacerts le inside the java directory (jre/lib/security/cacerts) is used for trust storage. To
import the certi cate, you can use keytool:
keytool -import -storepass changeit -file <certificate used by LDAP server> -keystore cacer

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

240

5/19/2023

For more information, see also https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19830-01/819-4712/ablqw/index.html

.

10. After nishing the con guration, choose Activate. Immediately after activating the LDAP con guration you must restart
the Cloud Connector server, which invalidates the current browser session. Refresh the browser and logon to the Cloud
Connector again, using the credentials con gured at the LDAP server.
11. To switch back to le-based user management, choose the Switch icon again.

 Note
If you have set up an LDAP con guration incorrectly, you may not be able to logon to the Cloud Connector again. In this case,
adjust the Cloud Connector con guration to use the le-based user store again without the administration UI. For more
information, see the next section.

Switching Back to File-Based User Store without the Administration UI
If your LDAP settings do not work as expected, you can use the useFileUserStore tool, provided with Cloud Connector version
2.8.0 and higher, to revert back to the le-based user store:
1. Change to the installation directory of the Cloud Connector and enter the following command:
Microsoft Windows: useFileUserStore
Linux, Mac OS: ./useFileUserStore.sh
2. Restart the Cloud Connector to activate the le-based user store.
For versions older than 2.8.0, you must manually edit the con guration les.
Depending on your operating system, the con guration le is located at:
Microsoft Windows OS: <install_dir>\config_master\org.eclipse.gemini.web.tomcat\default-

server.xml
Linux OS: /opt/sap/scc/config_master/org.eclipse.gemini.web.tomcat/default-server.xml
Mac OS X: /opt/sap/scc/config_master/org.eclipse.gemini.web.tomcat/default-server.xml
1. Replace the Realm section with the following:
<Realm className="org.apache.catalina.realm.LockOutRealm">
<Realm className="org.apache.catalina.realm.CombinedRealm">
<Realm X509UsernameRetrieverClassName="com.sap.scc.tomcat.utils.SccX509SubjectDnRetriever
<Realm X509UsernameRetrieverClassName="com.sap.scc.tomcat.utils.SccX509SubjectDnRetriever
</Realm>
</Realm>
2. Restart the Cloud Connector service:
Microsoft Windows OS: Open the Windows Services console and restart the cloud connector service.
Linux OS: Execute
System V init distributions: service scc_daemon restart
Systemd distributions: systemctl restart scc_daemon
Mac OS X: Not applicable because no daemon exists (for Mac OS X, only a portable variant is available).

Additional Notes

Introduction
Using an LDAP server for user management allows seamless integration of the Cloud Connector into the on-premise
environment. It requires some con guration that must match the setup on your LDAP server, and therefore can't be generated
automatically.
The con guration parameters are common for various products and mostly well known.
The apache tomcat project, which is used as underlying technology by the Cloud Connector, provides an excellent tutorial:
tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/realm-howto.html

. It explains the LDAP con guration parameters and considers various

LDAP directory setups, including their speci c con guration.
However, some aspects may raise questions. For this reason, we show you how to con gure LDAP and verify LDAP
con guration, providing useful background information in this topic.
A basic understanding of LDAP and tomcat's how-to guide is a prerequisite. As help tool, we are using the ldapsearch utility. You
can use any LDAP client for this procedure.
Back to Top

Connect to the LDAP Server
In a rst step, you must establish a connection to the LDAP server. Like an HTTP connection, the connection to LDAP can be
secure (via SSL/TLS) or plain. It points to a host and port. The address looks like this:
SSL/TLS connection: ldaps://<ldap.server.in.your.company>:<numeric port>
Plain connection: ldap://<ldap.server.in.your.company>:<numeric port>

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

242

5/19/2023

 Sample Code
ldapsearch -H ldap://<ldaphost>:<port>

The return value is -1 if the address is not reachable. Before you go ahead, you need to know the address of your LDAP server.
As soon as the ldapsearch utility returns a value other than -1, the address of the LDAP server is correct. More precisely, it
indicates only that there is a server listening on this port, which is supposed to be the LDAP server.
Once the address is known, you can test the connection in the Cloud Connector. Enter the address and add a dummy
con guration, for example, x="x", to outwit the check. Then choose the test icon in the upper right corner. For a valid address,
the LDAP con guration test in the Cloud Connector reports the following:

The message: Connecting to URL ldap://<ldaphost>:<port>; Exception performing authentication indicates that your LDAP
server requires user and password for queries.
Back to Top

SSL Issues
LDAP connection over SSL/TLS will run into SSL errors if the LDAP server uses an "untrusted" certi cate. This could be a selfsigned certi cate or a certi cate signed by a generally untrusted authority.
If you cannot use a trusted certi cate on your LDAP server, you must import the public part of the issuer certi cate to the JDK's
trust storage. See the JDK documentation how to do that.
Usually, the trust storage location is cacerts inside the java directory (jre/lib/security/cacerts). You can use the

keytool utility for import.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

243

5/19/2023

 Sample Code
keytool -import -storepass changeit -file <certificate used by LDAP server> -keystore cacerts -al

See also: Working with Certi cates and SSL

(Java documentation).

Back to Top

Authentication
If the address of the LDAP server is correct and the Cloud Connector can establish a connection, you can proceed with the next
step: the authentication by the LDAP directory.
The LDAP server may require authentication or not (anonymous connection), before a query can be executed. Authentication is
done by user and password, speci ed by the connectionName and connectionPassword properties.
Anonymous access is suﬃcient in most cases and provides the same level of security. However, you have to deal with the
existing setup on the LDAP server.

 Note
The LDAP user is not the same user that is later used to logon on to the Cloud Connector. It is a speci c user, which has
permissions to query the LDAP directory. It can be stored in an LDAP directory separated from other users. We recommend
that you specify the fully-quali ed user name like "uid=admin,ou=system".

Additionally, MS Active Directory allows authentication for user@domain, for example, ldapUser@company.local.
To verify the values, let's rst check the authentication with ldapsearch:

 Sample Code
ldapsearch -D "uid=admin,ou=system" -w <password> -H ldap://<ldaphost>:<port> -b "x=x"

 Note
We added a non-existing user base -b "x=x" to prevent long output.

The only thing to check here is, if authentication is ok. If it is not, LDAP returns INVALID_CREDENTIALS: Bind failed:

 Sample Code
ldapsearch -D "uid=admin,ou=system" -w <wrong password> -H ldap://<ldaphost>:<port> -b "x=x"
ldap_bind: Invalid credentials (49)
additional info: INVALID_CREDENTIALS: Bind failed: ERR_229 Cannot authenticate user uid=admin,ou=

You can perform the same test in the Cloud Connector UI:

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

244

5/19/2023

Choose the test icon in the upper right corner, and enter something as name and password:

Authentication failed in this check, but the connection to the LDAP server was successful.
If you get an Exception performing authentication message here, check the reply from the LDAP server and align your
parameters until you can connect.
Back to Top

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

245

5/19/2023

User Selection
Once authentication is checked, set the root node for users. User nodes are nodes containing user details. They are located
somewhere in the LDAP tree. Sometimes they are all listed under one branch (parent node), but they may also be distributed
across several branches. In any case, start with one branch that contains at least one user node.
List the user nodes with ldapsearch:

 Sample Code
ldapsearch -D "uid=admin,ou=system" -w <password> -H ldap://<ldaphost>:<port> -b "ou=users,dc=scc

The output contains the nodes located under the speci ed base. Each node looks like this:

 Sample Code
# Thor, users, scc
dn: uid=Thor,ou=users,dc=scc
sn: SCC Administrator
cn: sccadmin
objectClass: top
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: person
objectClass: organizationalPerson
userPassword:: ...
uid: Thor

Basically, every unique parameter can be used as user ID. The user Thor in this example could also enter its DN (distinguished
name) as user name. However, this is not very user-friendly. To not upset Thor, you can de ne the attribute containing the user
ID that is used for logon.

userSearch selects the attribute containing the user ID. Together with the userBase, the con guration looks like this now:

 Sample Code
userBase="ou=users,dc=scc"
userSearch="(uid={0})"

The corresponding LDAP selection is:

 Sample Code
ldapsearch -D "uid=admin,ou=system" -w <password> -H ldap://<ldaphost>:<port> -b "ou=users,dc=scc

Now, we take a closer look now at the response. The user Thor was found, its password was successfully validated by LDAP
server, but there are no speci c roles selected:

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

246

5/19/2023

Let's assume that the users are not located under the same branch in the LDAP tree. For this case, you cannot de ne more
than one userBase . Instead, you can set userBase for the corresponding parent node, which then includes all the user branches.
To achieve this, add userSubtree="true" to the con guration.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

247

5/19/2023

Taking a look at the relative name returned by search, it is uid=Thor,ou=users now.
Besides uid, you are free to use every other attribute of the user node. For example, for Active Directory, the preferred
attribute is often sAMAccountName, the corresponding con guration is userSearch="(sAMAccountName={0})".

 Note
For Active Directory, it might be necessary to add adCompat="true" to the con guration.

As mentioned above, you can use every attribute as user ID as long as it is unique . To verify this, check the query result for the
respective attribute with ldapsearch. If it contains more than one node, the test in the Cloud Connector would report User name

[<userid>] has multiple entries, No user found, Authentication for user <userid> failed. In our test, the CN (common name)
attribute is not unique and the following search returns more than one entry.

 Sample Code
ldapsearch -D "uid=admin,ou=system" -w <password> -H ldap://<ldaphost>:<port> -b "ou=users,dc=scc

 Note
If connectionUser is located under userBase and its ID can be selected by the same userSearch, you can use just the
user ID in the connectionUser eld instead of a fully-quali ed DN.

User Roles
At this point, the con guration let's you establish a connection to the LDAP server and authenticate a user.
In the next step, we con gure authorization, that is, the roles assigned to a user.
A role is a group in LDAP terms. The Cloud Connector provides the following roles: sccadmin, sccsubadmin, sccsupport,

sccmonitoring and sccdisplay.
Most likely, your LDAP server does not de ne such groups. Here, the best practice is to create new groups for role assignment.
Using these special groups for managing Cloud Connector users lets administrators easily grant permissions to the relevant
users. For example, only users with administrator permissions would be added to the sccadmin group. Like this, you avoid side
eﬀects, and you can increase the security and stability levels of the Cloud Connector.
Reuse of already existing groups is also possible. Set these group names as custom roles in the Cloud Connector's LDAP
con guration. However, keep in mind that every user in the existing group will automatically get permissions for the Cloud
Connector. Even if at present all users in the available group should have permissions for Cloud Connector, this could cause
issues at some point in the future. To avoid this, custom roles should not be used for reuse of existing groups on your LDAP
server. The main purpose of reused groups is to create group names that match your company's naming conventions.
Like users, also groups are represented as nodes in an LDAP tree branch. The branch where the groups are located must be
con gured as roleBase.
The roleName de nes, which of its attributes is taken as role name. Usually, you wouldn't use the fully-quali ed distinguished
name as role name.
Check if ldapsearch can nd entries for the role:

 Sample Code
ldapsearch -D "uid=admin,ou=system" -w <password> -H ldap://<ldaphost>:<port> -b "<roleBase>" "(&

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

249

5/19/2023

When trying to de ne only roleBase and roleName, the test reports no roles for the speci ed user: Found roles: []. The empty
brackets indicate an 'empty collection'. The reason is that the con guration does not de ne how users are related to the found
groups. Find some background information on this in the next section.
Back to Top

Relationship between User and Group
LDAP provides two ways to de ne the relationship between a user and its groups:
1. The group node contains one or more attributes uniqueMember, or
2. Uses one or more attributes memberOf in a user node.
Case 1: Extend the current con guration by roleSearch="(uniqueMember={0})".
The Cloud Connector's test reports direct roles in this case. Roles selected by roleSearch are LDAP entries. Using
con guration parameter roleName , you specify the LDAP entry attribute which will be the role name.
In our example, we are using roleName="cn" with the following result in the test: "Found direct role

cn=sccadmin,ou=groups,dc=scc -> sccadmin". The selected value sccadmin is the value of the attribute cn located in the
original LDAP entry.
Case 2: Extend the current con guration by userRoleName="memberOf".
This is reported by the Cloud Connector's test as internal role. If no groups are de ned by memberOf, the internal group
list is empty.

 Remember
This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

250

5/19/2023

The roles speci ed by an attribute of a user entry are used as is, that is, the con guration parameter roleName is
irrelevant in this case, and the role name is just set to the attribute value.

Below, the test report selected neither internal nor direct roles:

To demonstrate an empty result, the parameter roleSearch was set to a non-existing attribute here.
Below, the test re ecting LDAP con guration eventually reports a non-empty list of found roles, containing the role sccadmin:

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

251

5/19/2023

 Note
Like user nodes, also group nodes on the LDAP server may be located under several branches inside the "base" branch. In
this case, add the boolean attribute roleSubtree="true".

Back to Top

Custom User Roles
If you want to use non-default groups, you can set a group of your choice in the Custom Roles section. You can replace one or
more roles.

 Note
Keep in mind that the custom role de nition replaces the standard role. So, once a custom role for Administrator is set, the
standard one (sccadmin) is not eﬀective anymore.

Back to Top

Additional Notes
There are some more con guration parameters available that are out of scope here. Most LDAP con gurations are covered by
the parameters discussed above.
For special purposes, you may have to add to your con guration:

adCompat="true", if your LDAP server uses MS Active Directory and you encounter strange errors in the test report.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

252

5/19/2023

forceDnHexEscape="true", if your LDAP server uses MS Active Directory and there are non-standard characters in
the DN.

connectionTimeout="x", if you want to change the default of 5s.
General Recommendations
Don't use the userPattern parameter. It invalidates SSL/TLS-based authentication and high availability setup would
fail.
If the user ID has non-standard characters, escape them with \nn.
For back-slash, always use \\.

High Availability Setup
You can operate the Cloud Connector in a high availability mode, in which a master and a shadow instance are installed.
Task

Description

Install a Failover Instance for High Availability

Install a redundant Cloud Connector instance (shadow) that
monitors the main instance (master).

Master and Shadow Administration

Learn how to operate master and shadow instances.

Related Information

Install a Failover Instance for High Availability
The Cloud Connector lets you install a redundant instance that monitors the main instance.

Context
In a failover setup, when the main instance should go down for some reason, a redundant one can take over its role. The main
instance of the Cloud Connector is called master and the redundant instance is called the shadow. The shadow has to be
installed and connected to its master. During the setup of high availability, the master pushes the entire con guration to the
shadow. Later on, during normal operation, the master also pushes con guration updates to the shadow. Thus, the shadow
instance is kept synchronized with the master instance. The shadow pings the master regularly. If the master is not reachable
for a while, the shadow tries to take over the master role and to establish the tunnel to SAP BTP.

 Note
For detailed information about sizing of the master and the shadow instance, see also Sizing Recommendations.

Procedure
Preparing the Master Instance for High Availability
1. Open the Cloud Connector UI and go to the master instance.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

253

5/19/2023

2. From the main menu, choose High Availability.
3. Choose Enable.

If this ag is not activated, no shadow instance can connect to this Cloud Connector. Additionally, when providing a
concrete Shadow Host, you can ensure that only from this host a shadow instance can be connected.

 Caution
Pressing the Reset button resets all high availability settings to their initial state. As a result, high availability is
disabled and the shadow host is cleared. Reset only works if no shadow is connected.

Installing and Setting Up a Shadow Instance
Install the shadow instance in the same network segment as the master instance. Communication between master and shadow
via proxy is not supported. The same distribution package is used for master and shadow instance.

 Note
If you plan to use LDAP for the user authentication on both master and shadow, make sure you con gure it before you
establish the connection from shadow to master.

1. On rst start-up of a Cloud Connector instance, a UI wizard asks you whether the current instance should be master or
shadow. Choose Shadow and Save:

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

254

5/19/2023

2. From the main menu, choose Shadow Connector and provide connection data for the master instance, that is, the
master host and port. As of version 2.8.1.1, you can choose from the list of known host names, to use the host name
under which the shadow host is visible to the master. You can specify a host name manually, if the one you want is not on
the list. For the rst connection, you must log on to the master instance, using the user name and password for the
master instance. The master and shadow instances exchange X.509 certi cates, which will be used for mutual
authentication.

 Note
If you want to attach the shadow instance to a diﬀerent master, press the Reset button. All your high availability
settings will be removed, that is, reset to their initial state. This works only if the shadow is not connected.
3. Upon a successful connection, the master instance pushes the entire con guration plus some information about itself to
the shadow instance. You can see this information in the UI of the shadow instance, but you can't modify it.
4. The UI on the master instance shows information about the connected shadow instance. From the main menu, choose
High Availability:

5. As of version 2.6.0, the High Availability view includes an Alert Messages panel. It displays alerts if con guration changes
have not been pushed successfully. This might happen, for example, if a temporary network failure occurs at the same
time a con guration change is made. This panel lets an administrator know if there is an inconsistency in the
con guration data between master and shadow that could cause trouble if the shadow needs to take over. Typically, the
master recognizes this situation and tries to push the con guration change at a later time automatically. If this is
successful, all failure alerts are removed and replaced by a warning alert showing that there had been trouble before. As
of version 2.8.0.1, these alerts have been integrated in the general Alerting section; there is no longer a separate Alert
Messages panel.
If the master doesn't recover automatically, disconnect, then reconnect the shadow, which triggers a complete
con guration transfer.

Initial Con guration
Master and Shadow Administration

Master and Shadow Administration
Administration of Shadow Instances
There are several administration activities you can perform on the shadow instance. All con guration of tunnel connections,
host mappings, access rules, and so on, must be maintained on the master instance; however, you can replicate them to the
shadow instance for display purposes. You may want to modify the check interval (time between checks of whether the master
is still alive) and the takeover delay (time the shadow waits to see whether the master would come back online, before taking
over the master role itself).
As of Cloud Connector version 2.11.2, you can con gure the timeout for the connection check, by pressing the gear icon in the
section Connection To Master of the shadow connector main page.

The <Connection Timeout> eld speci es the maximum time allowed for establishing the technical connection to the master,
the <Request Timeout> de nes the maximum time allowed for executing the check over this connection. In the Timeout
Validation section, you can check the current settings by pressing the Execute button. If the timeouts are hit, you might want to
increase the settings accordingly.
Keep in mind the following points:
The log level on master and shadow instances can be diﬀerent.
Con guration for check interval and takeover delay is maintained only on the shadow instance, and is transferred to the
master for display purposes.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

256

5/19/2023

Audit logs are only written on the master instance and are not transferred to the shadow. However, if the shadow
becomes the master for some time, the audit log is potentially distributed over both master and shadow instances.
You can use the Reset button to drop all the con guration information on the shadow that is related to the master, but only if
the shadow is not connected to the master.

Required Con guration on the Shadow Instance
Once connected to the master, the shadow instance receives the con guration from the master instance. Yet, there are some
aspects you must con gure on the shadow instance separately:
User administration is con gured separately on master and shadow instances. Generally, it is not required to have the
same con guration on both instances. In most cases, however, it is suitable to con gure master and shadow in the same
way.
The UI certi cate is not shared. Each host can have its own certi cate, so you must maintain the UI certi cates on
master and shadow. You can use the same certi cate though.
SNC con guration: If secure RFC communication or principal propagation for RFC calls is used, you must con gure SNC
on each instance separately.

Failover Process
The shadow instance regularly checks whether the master instance is still alive. If a check fails, the shadow instance rst
attempts to reestablish the connection to the master instance for the time period speci ed by the takeover delay parameter.
If no connection becomes possible during the takeover delay time period, the shadow tries to take over the master role.
At this point, it is still possible for the master to be alive and the trouble to be caused by a network issue between the
shadow and master.
The shadow instance next attempts to establish a tunnel to the given SAP BTP subaccount. If the connection attempt
fails to all con gured subaccounts (for whatever reason), the shadow instance remains in "shadow status", periodically
pinging the master and trying to connect to the cloud, while the master is not yet reachable.
Otherwise, if the the tunnel to the cloud side can be opened, the shadow instance will take over the master role. From
this moment, the shadow instance displays the UI of a master instance and allows the usual operations of a master
instance, for example, starting/stopping tunnels, modifying the con guration, an so on.
This is, in particular, also the case if the master is still alive, but the network connection between shadow and master is
corrupted. This leads to a master-master setup, which is automatically detected on the former master once the network
between the two instances recovers. The former master will then automatically relinquish its master role and assume
the shadow role to get back to the desired setup.
When the original master instance restarts, it rst checks whether the registered shadow instance has taken over the master
role. If it has, the master registers itself as a shadow instance on the former shadow (now master) instance. Thus, the two
Cloud Connector installations, in fact, have switched their roles.

 Note
Only one shadow instance is supported. Any further shadow instances that attempt to connect are declined by the master
instance.

The master considers a shadow as lost, if no check/ping is received from that shadow instance during a time interval that is
equal to three times the check period. Only after this much time has elapsed can another shadow system register itself.

 Note

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

257

5/19/2023

On the master, you can manually trigger failover by selecting the Switch Roles button. If the shadow is available, the switch is
made as expected. Even if the shadow instance cannot be reached, the role switch of the master may still be enforced.
Select Switch Roles only if you are absolutely certain it is the correct action to take for your current circumstances.
Even with the active role switch, zero downtime is not guaranteed. Depending on various aspects and timings, there may be
short time slots in which establishing new connections fails. When switching the role, all active requests on the master will be
broken as the sockets will be closed.

Change the UI Port
Context
By default, the Cloud Connector uses port 8443 for its administration UI. If this port is blocked by another process, or if you
want to change it after the installation, you can use the changeport tool, provided with Cloud Connector version 2.6.0 and
higher.

 Note
On Windows, you can also choose a diﬀerent port during installation.

Procedure
1. Change to the installation directory of the Cloud Connector. To adjust the port and execute one of the following
commands:
Microsoft Windows OS:
changeport <desired_port>
Linux OS, Mac OS X:
./changeport.sh <desired_port>
2. When you see a message stating that the port has been successfully modi ed, restart the Cloud Connector to activate
the new port.

Connect and Disconnect a Cloud Subaccount
The major principle for the connectivity established by the Cloud Connector is that the Cloud Connector administrator should
have full control over the connection to the cloud, that is, deciding if and when the Cloud Connector should be connected to the
cloud, the accounts to which it should be connected, and which on-premise systems and resources should be accessible to
applications of the connected subaccount.
Using the administration UI, the Cloud Connector administrator can connect and disconnect the Cloud Connector to and from
the con gured cloud subaccount. Once disconnected, no communication is possible, either between the cloud subaccount and
the Cloud Connector, or to the internal systems. The connection state can be veri ed and changed by the Cloud Connector
administrator on the Subaccount Dashboard tab of the UI.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

258

5/19/2023

 Note
Once the Cloud Connector is freshly installed and connected to a cloud subaccount, none of the systems in the customer
network are yet accessible to the applications of the related cloud subaccount. Accessible systems and resouurces must be
con gured explicitly in the Cloud Connector one by one, see Con gure Access Control.

A Cloud Connector instance can be connected to multiple subaccounts in the cloud. This is useful especially if you need multiple
subaccounts to structure your development or to stage your cloud landscape into development, test, and production. In this
case, you can use a single Cloud Connector instance for multiple subaccounts. However, we recommend that you do not use
subaccounts running in productive scenarios and subaccounts used for development or test purposes within the same Cloud
Connector. You can add or a delete a cloud account to or from a Cloud Connector using the Add and Delete buttons on the
Subaccount Dashboard (see screenshot above).

Managing Subaccounts

Secure the Activation of Traﬃc Traces
For support purposes, you can trace HTTP and RFC network traﬃc that passes through the Cloud Connector.

Context
Traﬃc data may include business-critical information or security-sensitive data, such as user names, passwords, address data,
credit card numbers, and so on. Thus, by activating the corresponding trace level, a Cloud Connector administrator might see
data that he or she is not meant to. To prevent this behavior, implement the four-eyes principle, which is supported by the Cloud
Connector release 1.3.2 and higher.
Once the four-eyes principle is applied, activating a trace level that dumps traﬃc data will require two separate users:
An operating system user on the machine where the Cloud Connector is installed;
An Administrator user of the Cloud Connector user interface.
By assigning these roles to two diﬀerent people, you can ensure that both persons are needed to activate a traﬃc dump.

Four-Eyes Principle for Microsoft Windows OS
1. Create a le named writeHexDump in <scc_install_dir>\scc_config. The owner of this le must be a user other
than the operating system user who runs the cloud connector process.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

259

5/19/2023

 Note
Usually, this le owner is the user which is speci ed in the Log On tab in the properties of the cloud connector service
(in the Windows Services console). We recommend that you use a dedicated OS user for the cloud connector service.
Only the le owner should have write permission for the le.
The OS user who runs the cloud connector process needs read-only permissions for this le.
Initially, the le should contain a line like allowed=false.
In the security properties of the le scc_config.ini (same directory), make sure that only the OS user who
runs the cloud connector process has write/modify permissions for this le. The most eﬃcient way to do this is
simply by removing all other users from the list.
2. Once you've created this le, the Cloud Connector refuses any attempt to activate the Payload Trace ag.
3. To activate the payload trace, rst the owner of writeHexDump must change the le content from allowed=false to
allowed=true. Thereafter, the Administrator user can activate the payload trace from the Cloud Connector
administration screens.

Four-Eyes Principle for Linux OS/Mac OS X
1. Create a le named writeHexDump in /usr/local/vl/base/cfg (Cloud Connector 1.3.2) or
/opt/sap/scc/scc_config (Cloud Connector 2.x). The owner of this le must be a user other than the scctunnel
user (that is, the operating system user under which the cloud connector processes run) and not a member of the
operating system user group sccgroup.
Only the le owner should have write permission for the le.
The scctunnel user needs read-only permissions for this le.
Initially, the le should contain a line like allowed=false.
2. Once you've created this le, the Cloud Connector refuses any attempt to set the trace level higher than Runtime
(Cloud Connector 1.3.2) or to activate the Payload Trace ag (Cloud Connector 2.x).
3. To set a higher trace level, which includes traﬃc Hex-dumps (Cloud Connector 1.3.2), or to activate the payload trace
(Cloud Connector 2.x), the le owner mentioned above must rst change the le content from allowed=false to
allowed=true. Thereafter, the Administrator user can activate one of the higher trace levels (Cloud Connector 1.3.2)
or the payload trace (Cloud Connector 2.x) from the Cloud Connector administration screens.

Monitoring
Learn how to monitor the Cloud Connector from the SAP BTP cockpit and from the Cloud Connector administration UI.

Checking the Operational State
The simplest way to verify whether a Cloud Connector is running is to try to access its administration UI. If you can open the UI
in a Web browser, the cloud connector process is running.
On Microsoft Windows operating systems, the cloud connector process is registered as a Windows service, which is
con gured to start automatically after a new Cloud Connector installation. If the Cloud Connector server is rebooted, the
cloud connector process should also auto-restart immediately. You can check the state with the following command:
sc query "SAP Cloud Connector"
The line state shows the state of the service.
On Linux operating systems, the Cloud Connector is registered as a daemon process and restarts automatically each
time the cloud connector process is down, for example, following a system restart. You can check the daemon state
with the following command:
service scc_daemon status

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

5/19/2023

To verify if a Cloud Connector is connected to a certain cloud subaccount, log on to the Cloud Connector administration UI and
go to the Subaccount Dashboard, where the connection state of the connected subaccounts is visible, as described in section
Connect and Disconnect a Cloud Subaccount.

Monitoring from the Cockpit
The cockpit includes a Connectivity section, where users can check the status of the Cloud Connector(s) attached in the current
subaccount, if any, as well as information about the Cloud Connector ID, version, used Java runtime, high availability setup
(master and shadow instance), and so on (choose

Backend Connections

Performance Overview
All requests that travel through the Cloud Connector to a backend system, as speci ed through access control, take a certain
amount of time. You can check the duration of requests in a bar chart. The requests are not shown individually, but are assigned
to buckets, each of which represents a time range.
For example, the rst bucket contains all requests that took 10ms or less, the second one the requests that took longer than
10ms, but not longer than 20ms. The last bucket contains all requests that took longer than 5000ms.
In case of latency gaps, you may try to adjust the in uencing parameters: number of connections, tunnel worker threads, and
protocol processor worker threads. For more information, see Con guration Setup.
The collection of duration statistics starts as soon as the Cloud Connector is operational. You can delete all of these statistical
records by selecting the button Delete All. After that, the collection of duration statistics starts over.

 Note
Delete All deletes not only the list of most recent requests, but it also clears the top time consumers.

Back to Content

Most Recent Requests
This option shows the most recent requests:

The number of requests that are shown is limited to 50. You can either view all requests or only the ones destined for a certain
virtual host, which you can select.You can select a row to see more detail.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

264

5/19/2023

A horizontal stacked bar chart breaks down the duration of the request into several parts: external (backend), open connection,
internal (Cloud Connector), SSO handling, and latency eﬀects (between SAP BTP and Cloud Connector). The numbers in each
part represent milliseconds.

 Note
Parts with a duration of less than 1ms are not included.

In the above example, the selected request took 34ms, to which the Cloud Connector contributed 1ms. Opening a connection
took 18ms. Backend processing consumed 7ms. Latency eﬀects accounted for the remaining 8ms, while there was no SSO
handling necessary and hence it took no time at all.
Back to Content

Resource Filter Settings
To further restrict the selection of the listed 50 most recent requests, you can edit the resource lter settings for each virtual
host:

In the Edit dialog, select the virtual host for which you want to specify the resource lter and choose one or more of the listed
accessible resources. This list includes all resources that have been exposed during access control con guration (see also:
Con gure Access Control). If the access policy for an accessible resource is set to Path and all sub-paths, you can
further narrow the selection by adding one or more sub-paths to the resource as a suﬃx .

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

265

5/19/2023

Each selected resource/sub-path is listed separately in the resource lter list.

 Note
If you specify sub-paths for a resource, the request URL must match exactly one of these entries to be recorded. Without
speci ed sub-paths (and the value Path and all sub-paths set for a resource), all sub-paths of a speci ed resource
are recorded.

Back to Content

Top Time Consumers
This option is similar to Most Recent Requests; however, requests are not shown in order of appearance, but rather sorted by
their duration (in descending order). Furthermore, you can delete top time consumers, which has no eﬀect on most recent
requests or the performance overview.

Usage Statistics
To view the statistical data regarding the traﬃc handled by each virtual host, you can select a virtual host from the table. The
detail view shows the traﬃc handled by each resource , as well as a 24 hour overview of the throughput as a bar chart that
aggregates the throughput (bytes received and bytes sent by a virtual host, respectively) on an hourly basis.

 Note
Currently, this feature is only available for the protocols HTTP(S) and RFC (SNC). Virtual hosts using other protocols are not
listed.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

266

5/19/2023

The data that is collected includes the number of bytes received from cloud applications and the number of bytes sent back to
cloud applications. The time of the most recent access is shown for the virtual hosts, and in the detail view also for the
resources. If no access has taken place yet, the most recent access is shown as n.a. (not available). Similarly, the number of
bytes received and sent of a virtual host is the sum of bytes received and sent of its resources.
The tables listing usage statistics of virtual hosts and their resources let you delete unused virtual hosts or unused resources.
Use action Delete to delete such a virtual host or resource.

 Caution
In Cloud Connector versions before 2.14, usage statistics are collected during runtime only and are not stored when stopping
the Cloud Connector. That is, these statistics are lost when the Cloud Connector is stopped or restarted. Use care when
taking the decision to delete a resource or virtual host based on its usage statistics.
As of version 2.14, usage statistics are periodically stored to disk. The collected statistics are still available after a restart of
the Cloud Connector.
Actively deleted statistics are gone in either case.
A backup of the Cloud Connector settings does not include collected usage data. After restoring a Cloud Connector instance,
all monitoring collections are empty.

Using the Reset button, you can clean up all collected data. This might be helpful when monitoring a speci c use case.
For both virtual hosts and resources, you can use a classic Filter button to reduce the virtual hosts or resources to those that
have never been used (since the Cloud Connector started). For the virtual hosts, a second lter type is available that selects
only those virtual hosts that have been used, but include resources never used. This feature facilitates locating obsolete
resources of otherwise active virtual hosts.

This option shows a tabular overview of all active and idle connections, aggregated for each virtual host. By selecting a row
(each of which represents a virtual host) you can view the details of all active connections as well as a graphical summary of all
idle connections. The graphical summary is an accumulative view of connections based on the time the connections have been
idle.
The maximum idle time appears on the rightmost side of the horizontal axis. For any point t on that axis (representing a time
value ranging between 0ms and the maximal idle time), the ordinate is the number of connections that have been idle for no
longer than t. You can click inside the graph area to view the respective abscissa t and ordinate.

Monitoring (On-Premise to Cloud)
Monitor on-premise to cloud connections in the Cloud Connector.

Connections
This section shows a tabular overview of all currently opened logical connections, aggregated for each local port. You can
identify if and how many connections are currently opened through this speci c service channel.

Usage Statistics
Statistical data regarding the traﬃc handled by each port is shown in tabular form. From the table, you can select a service
channel. The respective detail views show a 24 hour overview as a bar chart that aggregates the throughput (bytes received
and bytes sent via a port, respectively) on an hourly basis.
The collected data comprises the number of bytes received from on-premise applications and the number of bytes sent to cloud
applications.
The table listing usage statistics of ports lets you delete unused service channels. Use action Delete to delete a service channel.

 Caution
Usage statistics are collected at runtime only. They are not stored when stopping the Cloud Connector. These statistics are
lost when the Cloud Connector is stopped or restarted. Be mindful of that fact, and use caution when taking the decision to
delete a service channel based on its usage statistics.

Using the Reset button you can clean up all collected data. This might be helpful when monitoring a speci c use case.
The table of service channels provides a lter button to reduce the service channels to those that have never been used (since
the Cloud Connector started).

Monitoring APIs
Use the Cloud Connector monitoring APIs to include monitoring information in your own monitoring tool.

Context
You might want to integrate some monitoring information in the monitoring tool you use.
For this purpose, the Cloud Connector includes a collection of APIs that allow you to read various types of monitoring data.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

268

5/19/2023

 Note
This API set is designed particularly for monitoring the Cloud Connector via the SAP Solution Manager, see Con gure
Solution Management Integration.

Before you start using these APIs, please also read the general introduction to REST APIs provided by Cloud Connector.

Prerequisites
You must use Basic Authentication or form eld authentication to read the monitoring data via API.
Users must be assigned to the roles sccmonitoring or sccadmin.

 Note
The Health Check API does not require a speci ed user. Separate users are available through LDAP only.

Available APIs
The following APIs are currently available.
Health Check (available as of version 2.6.0)
Subaccount Data (as of 2.10.0)
Open Connections to On-Premise Backend Systems (as of 2.10.0)
Open Connections to Cloud Services (as of 2.15.0)
Performance Data (as of 2.10.0)
Top Time Consumers (as of 2.11.0)

Alerting
Con gure the Cloud Connector to send e-mail messages when situations occur that may prevent it from operating correctly.
To con gure alert e-mails, choose Alerting from the top-left navigation menu.
You must specify the receivers of the alert e-mails (E-mail Con guration) as well as the Cloud Connector resources and
components that you want to monitor (Observation Con guration). The corresponding Alert Messages are also shown in the
Cloud Connector administration UI.

E-mail Con guration
1. Select E-mail Con guration to specify the list of em-ail addresses to which alerts should be sent (Send To).

 Note
The addresses you enter here can use either of the following formats: john.doe@company.com or John Doe
<j.doe@company.com>.
2. Enter the sender's e-mail address (<Sent From>).
3. In <SMTP Server> provide the host of the mail server.
4. You can specify an <SMTP port>, if the server is not using the default ports. For details, contact your e-mail
administrator or provider.
5. Mark the TLS Enabled check box if you want to establish a TLS-encrypted connection.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

285

5/19/2023

6. If the SMTP server requires authentication, provide <User> and <Password>.
7. In the Additional Properties section you can provide any property supported by the Java Mail library

. All speci ed

properties will be passed to the SMTP client.
8. Select Save to change the current con guration.

 Note
Connections to an SMTP server over SSL/TLS can cause SSL errors if the SMTP server uses an "untrusted" certi cate. If
you cannot use a trusted certi cate, you must import the public part of the issuer certi cate to the JDK's trust storage.
Usually, the trust storage is done in the le cacerts in the Java directory (jre/lib/security/cacerts). For import, you
can use the keytool utility:
keytool -import -storepass changeit -file <certificate used by SMTP server> -keystore cacerts -al

For more information, see https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19830-01/819-4712/ablqw/index.html

.

Observation Con guration
Once you've entered the e-mail addresses to receive alerts, the next step is to identify the resources and components of the
Cloud Connector: E-mail messages are sent when any of the chosen components or resources have malfunctioned or are in a
critical state.

 Note
The Cloud Connector does not dispatch the same alert repeatedly. As soon as an issue has been resolved, an informational
alert is generated, sent, and listed in Alert Messages (see section below).

1. Select Observation Con guration from the top-right corner of the window.
2. Select the components or resources you want to monitor.
High Availability alerts can occur in the context of an active high availability setup, meaning a shadow system is
connected.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

286

5/19/2023

Tunnel Health and Service Channels Health refer to the state of the respective connections. Whenever such a
connection is lost, an alert is triggered.

 Note
These alerts are only triggered in case of an error or exception, but not upon intentional disconnect action.
An excessively high CPU load over an extended period of time adversely aﬀects performance and may be an
indicator of serious issues that jeopardize the operability of the Cloud Connector. The CPU load is monitored and
an alert is triggered whenever the CPU load exceeds and continues to exceed a given threshold percentage (the
default is 90%) for more than a given period of time (the default is 60 seconds).
Although the Cloud Connector does not require nor consume large amounts of Disk space, running out of it is a
circumstance that you should avoid. We recommend that you con gure an alert to be sent if the disk space falls
below a critical value (the default is 10 megabytes).
The Cloud Connector con guration contains various Certi cates. Whenever one of those expires, scenarios might
no longer work as expected so it's important to get noti ed about the expiration (the default is 30 days).
3. (Optional) Change the Health Check Interval (the default is 30 seconds).
4. Select Save to change the current con guration.

Alert Messages
The Cloud Connector shows alert messages also on screen, in

Alerting

Alert Messages .

You can remove alerts using Delete or Delete All. If you delete active (unresolved) alerts, they reappear in the list after the next
health check interval.

Audit Logging
Audit log data can alert Cloud Connector administrators to unusual or suspicious network and system behavior.
Additionally, the audit log data can provide auditors with information required to validate security policy enforcement and
proper segregation of duties. IT staﬀ can use the audit log data for root-cause analysis following a security incident.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

287

5/19/2023

The Cloud Connector includes an auditor tool for viewing and managing audit log information about access between the cloud
and the Cloud Connector, as well as for tracking of con guration changes done in the Cloud Connector. The written audit log
les are digitally signed by the Cloud Connector so that their integrity can be checked, see Manage Audit Logs.

 Note
We recommend that you permanently switch on Cloud Connector audit logging in productive scenarios.
Under normal circumstances, set the logging level to Security (the default con guration value).
If legal requirements or company policies dictate it, set the logging level to All. This lets you use the log les to, for
example, detect attacks of a malicious cloud application that tries to access on-premise services without permission,
or in a forensic analysis of a security incident.

We also recommend that you regularly copy the audit log les of the Cloud Connector to an external persistent storage
according to your local regulations. The audit log les can be found in the Cloud Connector root directory

/log/audit/<subaccount-name>/audit-log_<timestamp>.csv.

Manage Audit Logs
Con gure audit log settings and verify the integrity of audit logs.

Con gure Audit Logs in the Cloud Connector
Choose Audit from your subaccount menu and go to Settings to specify the type of audit events the Cloud Connector should log
at runtime. You can currently select between the following Audit Levels (for either <subaccount> and <cross-subaccount>
scope):
Security: Default value. The Cloud Connector writes an audit entry (Access Denied) for each request that was blocked. It
also writes audit entries, whenever an administrator changes one of the critical con guration settings, such as exposed
back-end systems, allowed resources, and so on.
All: The Cloud Connector writes one audit entry for each received request, regardless of whether it was allowed to pass
or not (Access Allowed and Access Denied). It also writes audit entries that are relevant to the Security mode.
Oﬀ: No audit entries are written.

 Note
We recommend that you don't log all events unless you are required to do so by legal requirements or company policies.
Generally, logging security events only is suﬃcient.

To enable automatic cleanup of audit log les, choose a period (14 to 365 days) from the list in the eld <Automatic Cleanup>.
Audit entries for con guration changes are written for the following diﬀerent categories:

Account: A subaccount con guration was changed.
RecoveryAccount: A disaster recovery subaccount con guration was changed.
Configuration: A new subaccount was added or a disaster recovery switch happened.

The Time Range settings specify the time frame for which you want to display the audit events.
These lter criteria are combined with a logical AND so that all audit entries that match these criteria are shown. If you have

 Note
To prevent a single person from being able to both change the audit log level, and delete audit logs, we recommend that the
operating system administrator and the SAP BTP administrator are diﬀerent persons. We also suggest that you turn on the
audit log at the operating system level for le operations.

The

Check button checks all les that are ltered by the speci ed date range.

Verify the Integrity of Audit Logs
To check the integrity of the audit logs, go to <scc_installation>/auditor. This directory contains an executable go
script le (respectively, go.cmd on Microsoft Windows and go.sh on other operating systems).
If you start the go le without specifying parameters from <scc_installation>/auditor, all available audit logs for the
current Cloud Connector installation are veri ed.
The auditor tool is a Java application, and therefore requires a Java runtime, speci ed in JAVA_HOME, to execute:
For Microsoft Windows OS, set JAVA_HOME=<path-to-java-installation>
For Linux OS and Mac OS X, export: JAVA_HOME=<path-to-java-installation>
Alternatively, to execute Java, you can include the Java bin directory in the PATH variable.

Change the Location of Audit Logs
As of Cloud Connector 2.14 you can move audit logs to a diﬀerent location. Standard location remains log/audit.

 Note
Make sure there is enough space left on the device for the desired location and the Cloud Connector OS user has permission
to write les to that location.

If you want to do this, proceed as follows:
1. Shut down the Cloud Connector.
2. Execute the respective script for the location change.
a. For Microsoft Windows OS: changeAuditLogPath.bat <desiredLocation>.
b. For Linux OS and Mac OS X: ./changeAuditLogPath.sh <desiredLocation>.
3. The script checks if the target might be a network location. If this is assumed, the script asks for con rmation.
Afterwards, it tries to move all existing audit logs to the new location. Only after successful move, the location change
takes eﬀect, otherwise it remains in the old place.
4. Start the Cloud Connector again.

 Caution
If you choose a network location while access to the le system is slow, overall processing performance of the Cloud
Connector may decrease signi cantly.

To troubleshoot connection problems, monitor the state of your open tunnel connections in the Cloud Connector, and view
diﬀerent types of logs and traces.

 Note
For information about a speci c problem or an error you have encountered, see Connectivity Support.

Monitoring
To view a list of all currently connected applications, choose your Subaccount from the left menu and go to section Cloud
Connections:

The provided information includes:
Application name: The name of the application, as also shown in the cockpit, for your subaccount
Connections: The number of currently existing connections to the application
Connected Since: The earliest start time of a connection to this application
Peer Labels: The name of the application processes, as also shown for this application in the cockpit, for your subaccount

Log and Trace Settings
The Log and Trace Files page includes some les for troubleshooting that are intended primarily for SAP Support. These les
include information about both internal Cloud Connector operations and details about the communication between the local
and the remote (SAP BTP) tunnel endpoint.
If you encounter problems that seem to be caused by some trouble in the communication between your cloud application and
the on-premise system, choose Log and Trace Files from your Subaccount menu, go to section Settings, and activate the
respective traces by selecting the Edit button:
Cloud Connector Loggers adjusts the levels for Java loggers directly related to Cloud Connector functionality.
Other Loggers adjusts the log level for all other Java loggers available at the runtime. Change this level only when
requested to do so by SAP support. When set to a level higher than Information, it generates a large number of trace
entries.
CPIC Trace Level allows you to set the level between 0 and 3 and provides traces for the CPIC-based RFC
communication with ABAP systems.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

292

5/19/2023

When the Payload Trace is activated for a subaccount, all the HTTP and RFC traﬃc crossing the tunnel for that
subaccount going through this Cloud Connector, is traced in les with names traﬃc_trace_<subaccount

id>_on_<regionhost>.trc.

 Note
Use payload and CPIC tracing at Level 3 carefully and only when requested to do so for support reasons. The trace
may write sensitive information (such as payload data of HTTP/RFC requests and responses) to the trace les, and
thus, present a potential security risk. As of version 2.2, the Cloud Connector supports an implementation of a "foureyes principle" for activating the trace levels that dump the network traﬃc into a trace le. This principle requires two
users to activate a trace level that records traﬃc data. See Secure the Activation of Traﬃc Traces.
SSL Trace: When the SSL trace is activated, the ljs_trace.log le includes information for SSL-protected
communication. To activate a change of this setting, a restart is required. Activate this trace only when requested by
SAP support. It has a high impact on performance as it produces a large amount of traces.
Automatic Cleanup lets you remove old trace les that have not been changed for a period of time exceeding the
con gured interval. You can choose from a list of prede ned periods. The default is Never.

Change the Location of Trace Files
As of Cloud Connector 2.14 you can move trace les to a diﬀerent location.

 Note
JVM-related les will remain in the standard location log.

 Note
Make sure there is enough space left on the device for the desired location and the Cloud Connector OS user has permission
to write les to that location.

If you want to do this, proceed as follows:
1. Shut down the Cloud Connector.
2. Execute the respective script for the location change.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

293

5/19/2023

a. For Microsoft Windows OS: changeLogAndTracePath.bat <desiredLocation>.
b. For Linux OS and Mac OS X: ./changeLogAndTracePath.sh <desiredLocation>.
3. The script checks if the target might be a network location. If this is assumed, the script asks for con rmation.
Afterwards, it tries to move the existing current trace le to the new location. Only after successful move, the location
change takes eﬀect. Otherwise, the le remains in the old place.
4. Start the Cloud Connector again.

 Caution
If you choose a network location while access to the le system is slow, overall processing performance of the Cloud
Connector may decrease signi cantly.

Log and Trace Files
View all existing trace les and delete the ones that are no longer needed.

To prevent your browser from being overloaded when multiple large les are loaded simultaneously, the Cloud Connector loads
only one page into memory. Use the page buttons to move through the pages.
Use the Download/Download All icons to create a ZIP archive containing one trace le or all trace les. Download it to your local
le system for convenient analysis.

 Note
If you want to download more than one le, but not all, select the respective rows of the table and choose Download All.

When running the Cloud Connector with SAP JVM or as of version 2.14 also with other JVMs, you can trigger the creation of a
thread dump by choosing the Thread Dump button, which will be written to the JVM trace le log/vm_$PID_trace.log for SAP
JVM and log/vm_$PID_threads.log for other JVMs. You may be asked by SAP support to create one, if considered helpful during
incident analysis.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

294

5/19/2023

 Note
From the UI, you can't delete trace les that are currently in use. You can delete them from the Linux OS command line;
however, we recommend that you do not use this option to avoid inconsistencies in the internal trace management of the
Cloud Connector.

Two buttons may be helpful to solve issues on your own:
Guided Answers: A new tab or window opens, showing the Cloud Connector section in Guided Answers

. It helps you

identify many issues that are classi ed through hierarchical topics. Once you found a matching issue, a solution is
provided either directly, or by references to SAP Help Portal, Knowledge Base Articles (KBAs), and SAP notes.
Support Log Assistant: Opens the support log assistant. There, you can upload Cloud Connector log les and have them
analyzed. After triggering the scan, the tool lists all issues for which a solution can be identi ed.

 Note
The support log assistant analyzes the complete log. Therefore, also older issues may be found that are no longer
relevant.

Once a problem has been identi ed, you should turn oﬀ the trace again by editing the trace and log settings accordingly to not
ood the les with unnecessary entries.
Use the Refresh button to update the information that appears. For example, you can use this button because more trace les
might have been written since you last updated the display.

Error Analysis and Support: Which Logs are Relevant?
If you contact SAP support for help, please always attach the appropriate log les and provide the timestamp or period, when
the reported issue was observed. Depending on the situation, diﬀerent logs may help to nd the root cause.
Some typical settings to get the required data are listed below:

<Cloud Connector Loggers> provide details related to connections to SAP BTP and to backend systems as well as
master-shadow communication in case of a high availability setup. However, it does not contain any payload data. This
kind of trace is written into ljs_trace.log, which is the most relevant log for the Cloud Connector.

<Other Loggers> provide details related to the tomcat runtime, in which the Cloud Connector is running. The traces are
written into ljs_trace.log as well, but they are needed only in very special support situations. If you don't need these
traces, leave the level on Information or even lower.
Payload data are written into the traﬃc trace le for HTTP or RFC requests if the payload trace is activated, or into the
CPI-C trace le for RFC requests, if the CPI-C trace is set to level 3.

<TLS trace> is helpful to analyze TLS handshake failures from Cloud Connector to Cloud or from Cloud Connector to
backend. It should be turned oﬀ again as soon as the issue has been reproduced and recorded in the traces.
Setting the audit log on level ALL for <Subaccount Audit Level> is the easiest way to check if a request reached the the
Cloud Connector and if it is being processed.

On application level, the main tasks to ensure secure Cloud Connector operations are to provide appropriate frontend security
(for example, validation of entries) and a secure application development.

Product Security Standard
Basically, you should follow the rules given in the product security standard, for example, protection against cross-site scripting
(XSS) and cross-site request forgery (XSRF).

Scope and Design
This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

299

5/19/2023

The scope and design of security measures on application level strongly depend on the speci c needs of your application.

Service Layer
You can use SAP BTP Connectivity to securely integrate cloud applications with systems running in isolated customer networks.

Overview
After installing the Cloud Connector as integration agent in your on-premise network, you can use it to establish a persistent
TLS tunnel to SAP BTP subaccounts.
To establish this tunnel, the Cloud Connector administrator must authenticate himself or herself against the related SAP BTP
subaccount of which he or she must be a member. Once estabilshed, the tunnel can be used by applications of the connected
subaccount to remotely call systems in your network.

Architecture
The gure below shows a system landscape in which the Cloud Connector is used for secure connectivity between SAP BTP
applications and on-premise systems.
A single Cloud Connector instance can connect to multiple SAP BTP subaccounts, each connection requiring separate
authentication and de ning an own set of con guration.
You can connect an arbitrary number of SAP and non-SAP systems to a single Cloud Connector instance.
The on-premise system does not need to be touched when used with the Cloud Connector, unless you con gure trust
between the Cloud Connector and your on-premise system. A trust con guration is required, for example, for principal
propagation (single sign-on), see Con guring Principal Propagation.
You can operate the Cloud Connector in a high availability mode. To achieve this, you must install a second (redundant)
Cloud Connector (shadow instance), which takes over from the master instance in case of a downtime.
The Cloud Connector also supports the communication direction from the on-premise network to the SAP BTP
subaccount, using a database tunnel that lets you connect common ODBC/JDBC database tools to SAP HANA as well as
other available databases in SAP BTP.

Network Zones
Choosing a network zone for the Cloud Connector installation.
A company network is usually divided into multiple network zones according to the security level of the contained systems. The
DMZ network zone contains and exposes the external-facing services of an organization to an untrusted network, typically the
Internet. Besides this, there can be one or multiple other network zones which contain the components and services provided in
the company’s intranet.
You can set up the Cloud Connector either in the DMZ or in an inner network zone. Technical prerequisites for the Cloud
Connector to work properly are:
The Cloud Connector must have access to the SAP BTP landscape host, either directly or via HTTPS proxy (see also:
Prerequisites).
The Cloud Connector must have direct access to the internal systems it shall provide access to. I.e. there must be
transparent connectivity between the Cloud Connector and the internal system.
It’s a company’s decision, whether the Cloud Connector is set up in the DMZ and operated centrally by an IT department or set
up in the intranet and operated by the line of business.

Related Information
Network Zones

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

301

5/19/2023

Inbound Connectivity
For inbound connections into the on-premise network, the Cloud Connector acts as a reverse invoke proxy between SAP BTP
and the internal systems.

Exposing Resources
Once installed, none of the internal systems are accessible by default through the Cloud Connector: you must con gure
explicitly each system and each service and resource on every system to be exposed to SAP BTP in the Cloud Connector.
You can also specify a virtual host name and port for a con gured on-premise system, which is then used in the cloud. Doing this,
you can avoid that information on physical hosts is exposed to the cloud.

TLS Tunnel
The TLS (Transport Layer Security) tunnel is established from the Cloud Connector to SAP BTP via a so-called reverse invoke
approach. This lets an administrator have full control of the tunnel, since it can’t be established from the cloud or from
somewhere else outside the company network. The Cloud Connector administrator is the one who decides when the tunnel is
established or closed.
The tunnel itself is using TLS with strong encryption of the communication, and mutual authentication of both communication
sides, the client side (Cloud Connector) and the server side (SAP BTP).
The X.509 certi cates which are used to authenticate the Cloud Connector and the SAP BTP subaccount are issued and
controlled by SAP BTP. They are kept in secure storages in the Cloud Connector and in the cloud. Having encrypted and
authenticated the tunnel, con dentiality and authenticity of the communication between the SAP BTP applications and the
Cloud Connector is guaranteed.

Restricting Allowed Applications
As an additional level of control, the Cloud Connector optionally allows restricting the list of SAP BTP applications which are able
to use the tunnel. This is useful in situations where multiple applications are deployed in a single SAP BTP subaccount while only
particular applications require connectivity to on-premise systems.

Isolation on Subaccount Level
SAP BTP guarantees strict isolation on subaccount level provided by its infrastructure and platform layer. An application of one
subaccount is not able to access and use resources of another subaccount.

Supported Protocols
The Cloud Connector supports inbound connectivity for HTTP and RFC, any other protocol is not supported.
The payload sent via these protocols is encrypted on TLS/tunnel-level.
For the route from the Cloud Connector to the on-premise systems, Cloud Connector administrators have the choice for
each con gured on-premise system whether to use HTTP, HTTPS, RFC or RFC over SNC.
For HTTPS, you can con gure a so-called system certi cate in the Cloud Connector which is used for the trust
relationship between the Cloud Connector and the connected on-premise systems.
For RFC over SNC, you can con gure an SNC PSE in the Cloud Connector respectively.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

302

5/19/2023

Principal Propagation
The Cloud Connector also supports principal propagation of the cloud user identity to connected on-premise systems (single
sign-on). For this, the system certi cate (in case of HTTPS) or the SNC PSE (in case of RFC) is mandatory to be con gured and
trust with the respective on-premise system must be established. Trust con guration, in particular for principal propagation, is
the only reason to con gure and touch an on-premise system when using it with the Cloud Connector.

Related Information
Con guring Principal Propagation

Outbound Connectivity
The Cloud Connector supports the communication direction from the on-premise network to SAP BTP, using a database tunnel.
The database tunnel is used to connect local database tools via JDBC or ODBC to the SAP HANA DB or other databases onSAP
BTP, for example, SAP Business Objects tools like Lumira, BOE or Data Services.
The database tunnel only allows JDBC and ODBC connections from the Cloud Connector into the cloud. A reuse for other
protocols is not possible.
The tunnel uses the same security mechanisms as for the inbound connectivity:
TLS-encryption and mutual authentication
Audit logging
To use the database tunnel, two diﬀerent SAP BTP users are required:
A platform user (member of the SAP BTP subaccount) establishes the database tunnel to the HANA DB.
A HANA DB user is needed for the ODBC/JDBC connection to the database itself. For the HANA DB user, the role and
privilege management of HANA can be used to control which actions he or she can perform on the database.

Related Information
Using Service Channels

Audit Log
As audit logging is a critical element of an organization’s risk management strategy, the Cloud Connector provides audit logging
for the complete record of access between cloud and Cloud Connector as well as of con guration changes done in the Cloud
Connector.

Integrity Check
The written audit log les are digitally signed by the Cloud Connector so that they can be checked for integrity (see also:
Manage Audit Logs).

Cloud Infrastructure Layer
Infrastructure and network facilities of the SAP BTP ensure security on network layer by limiting access to authorized persons
and speci c business purposes.

Isolated Network
The SAP BTP landscape runs in an isolated network, which is protected from the outside by rewalls, DMZ, and communication
proxies for all inbound and outbound communications to and from the network.

Sandboxed Environments
The SAP BTP infrastructure layer also ensures that platform services, like the SAP BTP Connectivity, and applications are
running isolated, in sandboxed environments. An interaction between them is only possible over a secure remote
communication channel.

Physical and Environmental Layer
Learn about data center security provided for SAP BTP Connectivity.

Upgrade
Upgrade your Cloud Connector and avoid connectivity downtime during the update.
The steps for upgrading your Cloud Connector are speci c to the operating system that you use. Previous settings and
con gurations are automatically preserved.

 Caution
Upgrade is supported only for installer versions, not for portable versions, see Installation. Before upgrading, please check
the Prerequisites and make sure your environment ts the new version. We recommend that you create a Con guration
Backup before starting an upgrade.

Avoid Connectivity Downtime
If you have a single-machine Cloud Connector installation, a short downtime is unavoidable during the upgrade process.
However, if you have set up a master and a shadow instance, you can perform the upgrade without downtime by executing the
following procedure:
1. Shut down the shadow instance.
2. Perform the upgrade on the shadow instance. (Follow the relevant procedure below.)
3. Restart the shadow instance and wait until it has connected to the master instance.
4. Perform a Switch Roles operation by pressing the corresponding button in the master administration UI. The master
instance has now changed into a shadow instance.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

307

5/19/2023

 Caution
After upgrading the former shadow instance from a version prior to 2.13 and having switched its role to be the new
master instance, reset high availability settings in both instances now, before continuing to upgrade the second
instance from a version prior to 2.13 as well. The master-shadow connection must be re-established after both
instances have been upgraded from versions prior to 2.13 to versions 2.13 or higher.
5. Shut down the new shadow instance and perform the upgrade procedure on it as well.
6. Restart the new shadow instance and wait until it has connected to the already upgraded current master instance.
7. Perform again the Switch Roles operation if you want the previous master instance to act as the new master instance
again.
Result: Both instances have now been upgraded without connectivity downtime and without con guration loss.
For more information, see Install a Failover Instance for High Availability.

Microsoft Windows OS
1. Uninstall the Cloud Connector as described in Uninstallation and make sure to retain the existing con guration.
2. Reinstall the Cloud Connector within the same directory. For more information, see Installation on Microsoft Windows
OS.
3. Before accessing the administration UI, clear your browser cache to avoid any unpredictable behavior due to the
upgraded UI.

Linux OS
1. Execute the following command: :
rpm -U com.sap.scc-ui-<version>.rpm

 Note
Daemon extensions (as of Cloud Connector version 2.12.3)
All extensions to the daemon provided via scc_daemon_extension.sh mechanism will survive a version update.
An upgrade to version 2.12.3 will already consider an existing le, even though previous versions were not supporting
that feature.
2. Before accessing the administration UI, clear your browser cache to avoid any unpredictable behavior due to the
upgraded UI.

Update the Java VM
How to update the Java VM used by the Cloud Connector.
Sometimes you must update the Java VM used by the Cloud Connector, for example, because of expired SSL certi cates
contained in the JVM, bug xes, deprecated JVM versions, and so on.
If you make a replacement in the same directory, shut down the Cloud Connector, upgrade the JVM, and restart the
Cloud Connector when you are done.
If you change the installation directory of the JVM, follow the steps below for your operating system.
Make sure that the JVM has been installed successfully.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

308

5/19/2023

 Note
A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is not suﬃcient. You must use a JDK or SAP JVM.

Microsoft Windows OS
1. Make sure that the current user has administrative privileges.
2. Shutdown the Cloud Connector (for example, by stopping the corresponding Windows service or by double-clicking the
Stop SAP Cloud Connector shortcut).
3. Open the registry editor (regedit32) and locate the following registry entry:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\SAP\Cloud Connector.
4. Change the value JavaHome to re ect the installation directory of the new SAP JVM or JDK.

 Note
The bin subdirectory must not be part of the JavaHome value.
If the JavaHome value does not yet exist, create it here with a "String Value" (REG_SZ) and specify the full path of the
Java installation directory, for example: C:\Program Files\sapjvm.
5. Close the registry editor and restart the Cloud Connector.

Linux OS
1. Open a shell command line prompt as root user.
2. In this shell, set the environment variable JAVA_HOME, pointing to the installation directory of the new SAP JVM or JDK,
for example:
in csh/tcsh:
setenv JAVA_HOME /opt/sap/sapjvm_8
in sh/bash/dash/zsh:
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/sap/sapjvm_8
3. Execute the command
System V init distributions: service scc_daemon stop
systemd distributions: systemctl stop scc_daemon
4. Execute the command
System V init distributions: /opt/sap/scc/daemon.sh reinstall
systemd distributions: /opt/sap/scc/daemon.sh reinstallSystemd
5. Execute the command

Both Operating Systems
 Note
If you use your own CA certi cates for the Email con guration (see Alerting) or for LDAP (see Use LDAP for Authentication),
you must reimport them to the JVM trust store as described there.

After executing the above steps, the Cloud Connector should be running again and should have picked up the new Java version
during startup. You can verify this by logging in to the Cloud Connector with your favorite browser, opening the About dialogue
and checking that the eld <Java Details> shows the version number and build date of the new Java VM. After you veri ed that
the new JVM is indeed used by the Cloud Connector, delete or uninstall the old JVM.

Uninstallation
Uninstall an installer version or portable version of the Cloud Connector.
If you have installed an installer variant of the Cloud Connector, follow the steps for your operating system to uninstall
the Cloud Connector.
To uninstall a developer version, proceed as described in section Portable Variants.

Microsoft Windows OS
1. In the Windows software administration tool, search for Cloud Connector (formerly named SAP HANA cloud
connector 2.x).
2. Select the entry and follow the appropriate steps to uninstall it.
3. When you are uninstalling in the context of an upgrade, make sure to retain the con guration les.

Linux OS
To uninstall Cloud Connector 2.x, execute the following command:
rpm -e com.sap.scc-ui

 Caution
This command also removes the con guration les.

Mac OS X
There is no installer variant for Mac OS X, only a portable one.

Frequently Asked Questions
Answers to the most common questions about the Cloud Connector.

Technical Issues
Does the Cloud Connector send data from on-premise systems to SAP BTP or the other way around?
The connection is opened from the on-premise system to the cloud, but is then used in the other direction.
An on-premise system is, in contrast to a cloud system, normally located behind a restrictive rewall and its services aren’t
accessible thru the Internet. This concept follows a widely used pattern often referred to as reverse invoke proxy .

Is the connection between the SAP BTP and the Cloud Connector encrypted?
Yes, by default, TLS encryption is used for the tunnel between SAP BTP and the Cloud Connector.
If used properly, TLS is a highly secure protocol. It is the industry standard for encrypted communication and also, for example,
as a secure channel in HTTPS.
Keep your Cloud Connector installation and JDK updated to avoid the use of weak and deprecated ciphers for TLS
communication. Which cipher and TLS versions are actually used, is de ned by both the cloud region setup and the JDK that is
used for Cloud Connector. The TLS implementation used for the communication is the one of the JDK.

Can I use a TLS-terminating rewall between Cloud Connector and SAP BTP?
This is not possible. Basically, this is a desired man-in-the-middle attack, which does not allow the Cloud Connector to establish a
mutual trust to the SAP BTP side.

Can I copy/clone a Cloud Connector installation and use it in parallel on a diﬀerent machine?
This is not supported. You would face issues regularly, as those two instances will be considered as one, which is not expected by
the cloud side.
If you just want to move the installation to a new machine, create a backup via the Con guration Backup feature, create a new
installation, import the backup, and discard the previous installation.

What is the oldest version of SAP Business Suite that's compatible with the Cloud Connector?
The Cloud Connector can connect an SAP Business Suite system version 4.6C and newer.

more information read this SCN Article

.

Which con guration in the SAP BTP destinations do I need to handle the user management access to the Cloud User
Store of the Cloud Connector?
See Con gure an On-Premise User Store.

Is the Cloud Connector suﬃcient to connect the SAP BTP to an SAP ABAP back end or is SAP BTP Integration
needed?
It depends on the scenario: For pure point-to-point connectivity to call on-premise functionality like BAPIs, RFCs, OData services,
and so on, that are exposed via on-premise systems, the Cloud Connector might suﬃce.
However, if you require advanced functionality, for example, n-to-n connectivity as an integration hub, SAP BTP Integration –
Process Integration is a more suitable solution. SAP BTP Integration can use the Cloud Connector as a communication channel.

How much bandwidth does the Cloud Connector consume?
The amount of bandwidth depends greatly on the application that is using the Cloud Connector tunnel. If the tunnel isn’t
currently used, but still connected, a few bytes per minute is used simply to keep the connection alive.

What happens to a response if there's a connection failure while a request is being processed?
The response is lost. The Cloud Connector only provides tunneling, it does not store and forward data when there are network
issues.

Where should I install the Cloud Connector?
For productive instances, we recommend installing the Cloud Connector on a single purpose machine. This is relevant for
Security. For more details on which network zones to choose for the Cloud Connector setup, see Network Zones.

How does a disaster recovery setup look like for the Cloud Connector?
There is no explicit implementation of a disaster recovery setup for the Cloud Connector. However, it is actually not needed.
Instead, make sure you have machines available in some other data center than the one in which your productive setup is
running. Also, make sure you regularly generate a Con guration Backup.
If a disaster situation occurs, install the Cloud Connector again and restore the latest backup. Immediately after the restart
that is required after restoring the backup, you are back to a running setup, as long as all the backend systems are reachable
from the new location.

How many servers do I need to deploy the Cloud Connector?

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

312

5/19/2023

We recommend that you use at least three servers, with the following purposes:
Development
Production master
Production shadow

 Note
Do not run the production master and the production shadow as VMs inside the same physical machine. Doing so removes
the redundancy, which is needed to guarantee high availability. A QA (Quality Assurance) instance is a useful extension. For
disaster recovery, you will need two additional instances: another master instance, and another shadow instance as a
reserve for the disaster case.

What are the hardware requirements to deploy the Cloud Connector?
See: Prerequisites.

Can I send push messages from an on-premise system to the SAP BTP through the Cloud Connector?
No, this is not supported by the Cloud Connector.

Is NTLM supported for authorization against the proxy server?
No, the Cloud Connector currently supports only basic authentication.

Which operating systems are supported by the Cloud Connector?
See Prerequisites.

Which processor architectures are supported by the Cloud Connector?
We currently support 64-bit operating systems running only on an x86-64 processor (also known as x64, x86_64 or AMD64), and
for Linux also on the PowerPC Little Endian variant (also known as ppc64le ).
See: Prerequisites.

Can I use the Cloud Connector without an ABAP back end?
Yes, you should be able to connect almost any system that supports the HTTP Protocol, to the SAP BTP, for example, Apache
HTTP Server, Apache Tomcat, Microsoft IIS, or Nginx.

Can I authenticate with client certi cates con gured in SAP BTP destinations at HTTP services that are exposed via
the Cloud Connector?
No, this is not possible. For client certi cate authentication, an end-2-end TLS communication is required. This is not the case,
because the Cloud Connector needs to inspect incoming requests in order to perform access control checks.

How can I do connection pooling for HTTP services that are exposed via the Cloud Connector?
The Cloud Connector itself does not perform connection pooling, but provides a 1-to-1 mapping for each logical connection
received trough the tunnel.
By this mapping, a new connection to the backend system is opened, and kept open until closed either by the backend or by the
client on cloud side.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

313

5/19/2023

The actual connection pooling is de ned by the application client on cloud side:
If a connection is re-used in the client library, it is re-used on the Cloud Connector side as well.
If it is closed immediately, also the mapped one on Cloud Connector side will be closed immediately.

Can I open two windows or tabs in a single browser instance to administrate the Cloud Connector?
No, this is not supported and may cause odd behavior on the diﬀerent screens, in particular when trying to navigate through
multiple subaccounts. If you like to open the administration UI twice, use two separate browser instances.

Does the Cloud Connector delete or modify HTTP headers?
Modi cations of HTTP response headers are done if needed. In particular, Set-Cookie domains are adjusted according to the
con gured domain and host mappings. Also, in case of redirects, the location header will be adjusted according to the host
mappings. Modi cations of HTTP request headers are also done if needed, which is currently only the case for the Host header
content. It will be replaced by the internal host, if the host mapping con guration is set up accordingly. The Cloud Connector will
not delete any header that is sent by the cloud application. However, the Connectivity service will drop Connectivity servicespeci c headers, such as SAP-Connectivity-Authentication or SAP-Connectivity-ConsumerAccount so that
those headers will neither reach the Cloud Connector nor the eventual backend.

Administration
Are there Audit Logs for changes in the Cloud Connector?
Yes, nd more details here: Manage Audit Logs.

Is it possible to split authorization?
No, currently there is only one role that allows complete administration of the Cloud Connector.

Can I con gure multiple administrative subaccounts?
Yes, to enable this, you must con gure an LDAP server. See: Use LDAP for Authentication.

How can I reset the Cloud Connector's administrator password when not using LDAP for authentication?
Visit https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud to download the portable version of the Cloud Connector. Extract the users.xml
le in the con g directory to the con g directory of your Cloud Connector installation, then restart the Cloud Connector.
This resets the password and user name to their default values.
You can manually edit the le; however, we strongly recommend that you use the users.xml le.

How do I create a backup of the Cloud Connector con guration?
Starting with Cloud Connector version 2.11, you can use a dedicated backup feature, either from the administration UI (see
Con guration Backup) or via REST API (see Backup).

Can I create a backup of the complete installation?
Yes, you can create an archive le of the installation directory to create a full backup. Before you restore from a backup, note
the following:
If you restore the backup on a diﬀerent host, the UI certi cate will be invalidated.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

314

5/19/2023

Before you restore the backup, you should perform a “normal” installation and then replace the les. This registers the
Cloud Connector at your operating systems package manager.

Why do I need a user ID during con guration?
This user opens the tunnel and generates the certi cates that are used for mutual trust later on.
The user is not part of the certi cate that identi es the Cloud Connector.
In both the Cloud Connector UI and in the SAP BTP cockpit, this user ID appears as the one who performed the initial
con guration (even though the user may have left the company).

What happens to a Cloud Connector connection if the user who created the tunnel leaves the company?
This does not aﬀect the tunnel, even if you restart the Cloud Connector.

What do changes in major or minor version numbers mean?
The semantics of Cloud Connector versions are explained in detail here

.

For how long does SAP continue to support older Cloud Connector versions?
Each Cloud Connector version is supported for 12 months, which means the cloud side infrastructure is guaranteed to stay
compatible with those versions.
After that time frame, compatibility is no longer guaranteed and interoperability could be dropped. Furthermore, after an
additional 3 month, the next feature release published after that period will no longer support an upgrade from the deprecated
version as a starting release.

What is the diﬀerence between “subaccount name” and “subaccount user”?
SAP BTP customers can purchase subaccounts and deploy applications into these subaccounts.
Additionally, there are users, who have a password and can log in to the cockpit and manage all subaccounts they have
permission for.
A single subaccount can be managed by multiple users, for example, your company may have several administrators.
A single user can manage multiple subaccounts, for example, if you have multiple applications and want them (for
isolation reasons) to be split over multiple subaccounts.
Find your account name by taking the following steps:
1. Open the SAP BTP cockpit.
2. Log in with your subaccount user.
3. You’ll see the subaccount name in the top left section of the screen.
For trial users, the account name is typically your user name, followed by the suﬃx “trial”:

Features
Does the Cloud Connector work with the SAP BTP Cloud Foundry environment?
As of version 2.10, the Cloud Connector can establish a connection to regions based on the SAP BTP Cloud Foundry
environment. Newer regions, however, require a Cloud Connector version 2.11 or higher.

Does the Cloud Connector work with SAP S/4HANA Cloud?
As of version 2.10, the Cloud Connector oﬀers a Service Channel to S/4HANA Cloud instances, given that they are associated
with the respective SAP BTP subaccount. For more information, see Using Service Channels.
Also supported as of version 2.10: S/4HANA Cloud communication scenarios invoking HTTP services or remote-enabled function
modules (RFMs) in on-premise ABAP systems.

Does the Cloud Connector work with the SAP BTP ABAP environment?
As of version 2.11, the Cloud Connector supports communication from and to the SAP BTP ABAP environment, when using the
Neo Connectivity service. Using the Cloud Foundry Connectivity service requires a Cloud Connector version 2.12.3 or higher.

How do I bind multiple Cloud Connectors to one SAP BTP subaccount?
As of version 2.9, you can connect multiple Cloud Connectors to a single subaccount. This lets you assign multiple separate
corporate network segments.
Those Cloud Connectors are distinguishable based on the location ID, which you must provide to the destination con guration
on the cloud side.

 Note
During an upgrade, location IDs provided in earlier versions of the Cloud Connector are dropped to ensure that running
scenarios are not disturbed.

Is WebSocket communication through the Cloud Connector supported?

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

316

5/19/2023

Yes, this is possible as of version 2.12.

Is there any plan to add traﬃc management functionality in Cloud Connector?
No, this functionality is not currently planned.

Can I use the Cloud Connector from cloud to on-premise for any protocol?
As of version 2.10, you can use the TCP channel of the Cloud Connector, if the client supports a SOCKS5 proxy to establish the
connection. However, only the HTTP and RFC protocols currently provide an additional level of access control by checking
invoked resources.

Can I use the Cloud Connector from on-premise to cloud for any protocol?
This is possible only for a limited set of protocols. You can use the Cloud Connector as a JDBC or ODBC proxy to access the
HANA DB instance within your SAP BTP Neo subaccount (service channel). This is sometimes referred to as “HANA protocol”.
Also, there are service channels for SSH access to SAP BTP Neo virtual machines, and for RFC access to ABAP cloud systems.
All of these service channels provide access to endpoints that are not visible in the Internet.
For HTTP, the endpoints that could be addressed are visible in the Internet. Therefore, you can simply use your normal network
infrastructure that is prepared for accessing HTTPS endpoints in the Internet anyway.

Can I check the communication of the service channel?
No, the audit log monitors access only from SAP BTP to on-premise systems.

Troubleshooting
How do I x the “Could not open Service Manager” error message?
You are probably seeing this error message due to missing administrator privileges. Right-click the cloud connector shortcut
and select Run as administrator.
If you don’t have administrator privileges on your machine you can use the portable variant of the Cloud Connector.

 Note
The portable variants of the Cloud Connector are meant for nonproductive scenarios only.

How do I set JAVA_HOME and PATH correctly?
JAVA_HOME must point to the installation directory of your SAP JVM or JDK while PATH must contain the bin folder inside the
installation directory of your SAP JVM or JDK. This is relevant in particular for the portable versions. The installers will also
detect JDKs in other places.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

317

5/19/2023

How do I use the various .bat-Batch or .sh-Shell script tools in the Cloud Connector directory?
Open a command line prompt with administrator privileges or with suﬃcient user privileges to read and write les in the Cloud
Connector directory. Then, make sure the environment variable JAVA_HOME is set to the installation directory of the JDK used
by the Cloud Connector.
Afterwards, switch to the Cloud Connector directory and call the appropriate batch or shell script tools via <toolname>.bat
or ./<toolname>.sh. If the respective tool script requires further input parameters, its usage syntax will be written to the
console.

When I try to open the Cloud Connector UI, Google Chrome opens a Save as dialog, Firefox displays some cryptic
signs, and Internet Explorer shows a blank page, how do I x this?
This happens when you try to access the Cloud Connector over HTTP instead of HTTPS. HTTP is the default protocol for most
browsers.
Adding “https://” to the beginning of your URL should x the problem. For localhost, you can use

https://localhost:8443/.

Request and Response Payload Format
The payload (that is, the data transmitted in the body) of requests and responses is mostly coded in JSON format. The following
example shows the request payload {description:<value>} coded in JSON:
{"description": "very helpful description"}

Values that represent a date are provided as a UTC long number, which is the number of milliseconds since 1 January 1970
00:00:00 UT (GMT+00).
In case of errors, the HTTP status code is 4xx. Error details are supplied in the response body in JSON format:

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

318

5/19/2023

{type: <type>, message: <message>}
where type can be one of the following strings:

INVALID_REQUEST, ILLEGAL_STATE, NOT_FOUND, INVALID_CONFIGURATION, RUNTIME_FAILURE, SHADOW_UPDATE, F

The request JSON is listed in the API descriptions in an abbreviated form, showing only the property names and omitting the
values. Details on the values (data types and restrictions) are provided separately below the respective API descriptions.
The API documentation also includes possible error types, and details on those errors below the API description. These errors
pertain to property values of the payload only. We do not claim this list of errors to be exhaustive. In particular, errors caused by
obviously erroneous input, such as missing mandatory or malformed property values, may have been omitted. As a rule of
thumb, missing or invalid values result in INVALID_REQUEST. Errors caused elsewhere (for example, inappropriate header eld
values) are not listed.

 Note
Request bodies in JSON format require the header eld Content-Type application/json . The API descriptions do not explicitly
mention this fact. Header elds are shown only if they deviate from the default Content-Type: application/json .

Back to Top

Security and Session
The Cloud Connector supports the authentication types basic authentication and form-based authentication. Once
authenticated, a client can keep the session and execute subsequent requests in the session. A session avoids the overhead
caused by authentication. As usual, the session ID can be obtained from the response header eld Set-cookie (as JSESSIONID=

<session Id>), and must be sent in the request header Cookie: JSESSIONID=<session Id>.
The Cloud Connector employs CSRF tokens to counter CSRF (cross-site request forgery) attacks. Upon rst request, a CSRF
token is generated and sent back in the response header in eld X-CSRF-Token . The client application must retain this token and
send it in all subsequent requests as header eld X-CSRF-Token together with the session cookie as explained above.

 Note
No CSRF token is generated if request header eld Connection has the value close (as opposed to keep-alive ). In other
words, if you want to make stateful, session-based REST calls, use Connection: keep-alive , extract the CSRF token from the
rst response header and subsequently include it in all request headers. Otherwise, use Connection: close and always submit
user and password through basic authentication.

An inactive session will incur a timeout at some point, and will consequently be removed. A request using an expired session will
receive a login page (Content-type: text/html). The status code of the response is 200 in this case. Hence, the only way to
detect an expired session is to pay attention to the content type and status code. Content type text/html in a connection with
status code 200 indicates an expired session.
For security reasons, a session should be closed or invalidated once it is not needed anymore. You can achieve this by including

Connection: close in the header of the nal call involving the session in question. As a result, the Cloud Connector invalidates the
session. Subsequent attempts to send a request in the context of that session respond with a login page as explained above.

Return Codes
Successful requests return the code 200, or, if there is no content, 204. POST actions that create new entities return 201, with
the location link in the header (that is, the value of the header eld location is the full URI of the entity created).
The following general errors can be returned by each API:
400 – Invalid request. For example, if parameters are invalid or the API is not supported anymore, or an unexpected
state occurs, as well as in case of other non-critical errors.
401 – Authorization required.
403 – The current Cloud Connector instance does not allow the request. Typically, this is the case when the initial
password has not been changed yet.
404 – The speci ed entity does not exist.
405 – An entity does not support the requested operation.
409 – Current state of the Cloud Connector does not allow a particular request as it con icts with certain rules or
violates certain constraints.
415 – Unexpected MIME type.
500 – Operation failed.
Most APIs return speci c error details depending on the situation. Such errors are addressed by the respective API description.

 Note
The error texts depend on the request locale.
