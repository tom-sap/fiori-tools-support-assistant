What Is SAP Business Application Studio?
SAP Business Application Studio is a new SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) service that oﬀers a modern
development environment tailored for eﬃcient development of business applications for the SAP Intelligent Enterprise.
SAP Business Application Studio is based on Code-OSS, an open source used for building Visual Studio Code. Available as a
cloud service, SAP Business Application Studio provides a desktop-like experience similar to leading IDEs, with command line
and optimized editors. At the heart of SAP Business Application Studio are the dev spaces. The dev spaces are comparable to
isolated virtual machines in the cloud containing tailored tools and preinstalled runtimes per business scenario, such as SAP
Fiori, SAP S/4HANA extensions, Work ow, Mobile and more. This simpli es and saves time in setting up your development
environment and allows you to eﬃciently develop, test, build, and run your solution locally or in the cloud.

Scenarios
SAP Business Application Studio provides a tailor-made development environment for various development scenarios, such as
SAP Fiori, SAP S/4HANA extension, and Work ow. With each of these scenarios, you can create diﬀerent types of applications.
In the Dev Space Types section, you can learn about each scenario.

Capabilities
In SAP Business Application Studio, you are provided with one or more dev spaces. A dev space is a development environment
with all the tools, capabilities, and resources needed for developing your application. Each type of application requires a
diﬀerent development environment. Based on the type of application that you choose to build, you're provided with a diﬀerent
set of tools. You can add additional tools to supplement the application with additional extensions for the scenario.
The dev space is an isolated development environment providing a local-like development experience. Among other tools, it
provides terminal access to the le system so that you can run various commands. You can test-run your application in the dev
space itself without deploying to the target runtime (Cloud Foundry), almost as if you were working on your own desktop.
Unlike other desktop IDEs, SAP Business Application Studio is equipped with various tools specially built for developing business
applications in the SAP ecosystem.
These tools cover the end-to-end development cycle:
Clone an existing project with a Git client or create a new project using templates.
Use editors for SAP-speci c technologies.
Easily test your application on your dev space while consuming services from remote sources.
Build and deploy the application as a multitarget application (MTA).

Dev Spaces in SAP Business Application Studio
A dev space is a development environment with the tools, capabilities, and resources needed for developing your
application.
Working in SAP Business Application Studio
SAP Business Application Studio provides the features needed for the entire life cycle of your application, from the
moment you create the project until it is ready to be deployed.
Working with a Trial Account
Get a trial account to experience SAP Business Application Studio for free.
Restrictions
Troubleshooting
Contact SAP Support
We suggest you report an incident or error through the SAP Support Portal.

Dev Spaces in SAP Business Application Studio
A dev space is a development environment with the tools, capabilities, and resources needed for developing your application.
A dev space provides tailored tools and pre-installed runtimes for your business scenario. This simpli es and saves time in
setting up your development environment and allows you to eﬃciently develop, test, build, and run your solution locally or in the
cloud.
Each dev space type contains a set of prede ned extensions that help improve your experience.
An SAP Business Application Studio extension is a set of tools that help you perform a speci c development task. For example,
the Java Tools extension provides you with the tools that you need to develop a Java application. The Fiori Tools extension
includes the templates, CLI, and code completion required to create an SAP Fiori application.
During dev space creation, you can choose to add additional extensions to the dev space. The additional extensions provide
additional tools to supplement the application with additional components for the scenario to your developer environment. See
Additional Extensions.
You can also add extensions to an existing dev space. See Add Extensions to Your Dev Space.
When creating a new dev space, select the dev space type that best ts the application you want to create. See Dev Space
Types.

Con gure Your Dev Space Settings
You can con gure your preferred settings for working in the dev space:
1. Open your dev space.
2. From the left-side menu, select

File

Preferences

Settings .

3. Con gure your settings:
Keyboard shortcuts
Color theme
File icon theme
General preferences

 Note
This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

38

5/19/2023

Settings are relevant per dev space. You must con gure your settings for each dev space separately.

You can create, delete, stop, and start dev spaces. You can also download dev space content, and import dev space content. See
Working in the Dev Space Manager.

 Note
Dev spaces not used for more than 30 days are archived to save on disk space. You can still access them just like any other
dev space, but they might take up to 1 minute longer to load.

Using Additional Tools
It is possible to install additional tools on a dev space or consume additional software components for developing applications
using the terminal, the dedicated UI, or directly in the code.

 Note
SAP provides you with a mechanism to access third party sites to view and download open-source, 3rd party or its own tools,
libraries, or software components (“Extensions”) to dev spaces in SAP Business Application Studio. Using this mechanism,
you can view and install Extensions at your own risk.
SAP does not certify or endorse any of the third-party sites or Extensions, and they are not part of SAP Business Application
Studio.
You must ensure that you have all the necessary rights to use these Extensions.
You are responsible for all aspects of the Extensions, including maintenance, management, security, and support.
You will assume all responsibility for any negative eﬀects caused by or relating to the Extensions.
SAP may disable any dev space that includes Extensions that cause system malfunction or that SAP reasonably believes
may cause harm to SAP systems.

Working in the Dev Space Manager
You can create, delete, stop, and start dev spaces. You can also download dev space content, and import dev space content.

Create a Dev Space
You can generate a dev space to create and manage applications. You can select the application type that includes the
extensions that you need to do a development task.
1. Open SAP Business Application Studio and log in with your credentials.
2. Click Create Dev Space.
3. Enter a name for the dev space.
4. Select the relevant application type.
5. (Optional) Select the relevant additional extensions to enhance your space.
You can also add or remove extensions later. See the Add Extensions to Your Dev Space section.
6. Click Create Dev Space.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

39

5/19/2023

 Note
You can only click the button if you entered a dev space name.

 Note
Dev Space creation is in uenced by the application plan you are using.
If you are using a productive account, see SAP Business Application Studio Restrictions.
If you are using a free account, see Free Plan Restrictions.
If you are using a trial account, see Trial Account Restrictions.

Stop, Start, or Delete Your Dev Space
If you don't need to work with your dev space for a while, you can stop your dev space. When your dev space is running, it
consumes memory, energy, and CPU. If you don't use your dev space and it sits idle for a while, the dev space is stopped.
When you restart your stopped dev space, all content in your dev space, including les and settings, are available. If you want to
apply updates to extensions and bug xes, you must stop your dev space and start it again.
You can also delete your dev space.

 Note
By creating a dev space, you create a project and le system for yourself. If you delete your dev space, you can't recover it.
We recommend syncing, backing up, and saving your project to a Git repository. See Connect to Your Git Source Control
System.

Add or Remove Extensions
You can change the extensions you selected for your dev space.
1. From the Dev Space Manager, click

to edit the dev space.

 Note
To edit an extension, the dev space must be in the stopped state.
2. Select the additional SAP extensions that you want to add, or clear the checkmark from extensions you want to remove.
3. Click Save Changes.

Download Dev Space Content
You can download the dev space content in the following situations:
When your dev space is in the RUNNING state to save the dev space contents.
When your dev space is in the ERROR state to recover your data and move the contents to another dev space.
To download the content of your dev space, click

and then Download.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

40

5/19/2023

If your dev space is in the ERROR state, after the download begins, the dev space state changes to STARTING. The dev space
state then changes to SAFE MODE and then the tar le downloads.
After the dev space changes to SAFE MODE, it's not possible to return to the RUNNING state. You can only download the dev
space content and delete the dev space.
When the export process is complete, the tar le, with the dev space content, is downloaded.

 Note
After exporting the dev space content, check the size of the dev space before uploading. Make sure that the size doesn't
exceed 10 GB.

Import Dev Space Content
After downloading the dev space content, you can import the content to another dev space:
1. Create a new dev space, start it, and open it.
2. From the Explorer view, click Open Folder.
The path to the user folder (/home/user/) is displayed in the command palette.
3. Click OK to open the user folder.
4. Right-click the projects folder and click Upload...
5. From the Downloads folder, choose the le with the dev space content.
6. Right-click the projects folder and click Open in Integrated Terminal.
7. Enter the following command to uncompress the uploaded le:
tar xvzf <Your.tar.gzFile>

Dev Space Types
When creating a new dev space, select the dev space type that best ts the application you want to create.
SAP Business Application Studio has the following dev space types:

Understanding the UI
SAP Business Application Studio provides a graphical user interface for executing Git commands and managing your source
control and versioning.

Understanding the UI
The Git view consists of three major sections. The top section is for authoring the commit messages. It also provides access to a
couple of basic Git commands.

Below this, you nd the commit section, which lists the changed les by their name and separates them in two groups:
Staged Changes - A list of the les that have been staged. Click

to open the selected le, or

to unstage it.

Changes - Files listed under the Changes section contain unstaged changes. Each le name is followed by a path to its
parent directory and an indicator describing the status of the change.
Click

to open the selected le,

to stage the le, or

to refresh it.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

84

5/19/2023

The les can be in any of the following statuses:
A - A new le that has been staged.
U - An unstaged le. An unstaged change can be reverted by clicking on the Discard Changes action next to the le
location.
M - A modi ed le. Double-clicking on a modi ed le will open it in a diﬀ editor. The read-only editor on the left-hand side
shows the state from the index. The right-hand side of the editor re ects the state of the working tree, and it lets you to
further modify the le.
C - A copied le (if blue) or a con icted le (if red).
D - A deleted le.
At the bottom of the Git view you can see the last commit section, where a description of the most recent commit is displayed.
After staging the desired les and specifying the commit message, the changes can be committed to the repository. After a
successful commit, the Last Commit section is automatically updated.

Git Commands
SAP Business Application Studio supports Git commands from the Git view and from the command palette.

The resource is bound to the service.

This updates the resource's con guration les. See the Advanced Options section below to see the changes made to the
con guration les.
If you're binding to an SAP HANA service, a new connection called '<my_service_instance name>' is added to the
SQLTools view where your tables and data are displayed.
Unbinding the resource removes all of the changes made to the con guration les.
To unbind the resource:
1. Open the Run Con gurations view.
2. Select the desired con guration.
3. Select the desired resource.
4. Click

(unbind).

(Run) to run the project.

Prelaunch and dependent tasks are run.
The Debug Console opens.
4. Click Open in New Tab to view the UI in a new tab.
5. If you need to stop a con guration that is already running, you can do so from the Run and Debug view.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

124

5/19/2023

 Note
For more information about the tasks triggered by the run con guration, see the Advanced Options section below.
Stopping a con guration from the Run and Debug view doesn't stop any running tasks.

Edit a Run Con guration
1. Right-click a relevant run con guration to do the following:
Con gure Environment - Open the environment le to view the binding con guration.
Rename - Provide a new name for the selected run con guration.
Show in File - Open the JSON le containing the set of con guration properties, with the name highlighted.
Delete - Delete the set of con guration properties from the JSON le.

Delete a Run Con guration
1. Right-click a run relevant con guration and choose Delete.

 Note
If you delete the launch con guration, it's removed from the launch.json le but the tasks remain.

Advanced Options
In addition to the launch.json le that is created as part of the new con guration, the following les are added or updated
when creating a run con guration:
Environment con guration le
A new environment le is created. After the resource is bound to a service, the le is populated with all the environment
variables required to connect to Cloud Foundry.
The environment con guration le is referenced from your Launch con guration.

New tasks in the tasks.json le

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

125

5/19/2023

The following tasks are added to the tasks.json le:
A technical generic task. This is the con guration's prelaunch task.
This task enables you to de ne additional tasks to run before starting the con guration (using the dependsOn
property).

A task that triggers the Apache Tomcat server running with the context of the application resources.
A build task that triggers the mvn clean install command.
Tomcat runtime con guration directory
When you create a new con guration, a new Tomcat runtime con guration directory is created containing the following
con guration les:

ROOT.xml (user/.tomcat/<configuration_name>/Catalina/localhost)
For example, /home/user/.tomcat/bookshop-srv-1/conf/Catalina/localhost

server.xml (user/.tomcat/<configuration_name>/conf)
For example, /home/user/.tomcat/bookshop-srv-1/conf

 Note
By default, Tomcat runs on port 8080. If you want to run multiple con gurations at the same time, you need to
con gure a diﬀerent port for the additional Tomcat in the server.xml le. In addition, you need to change the
default ports 8009 and 8005 de ned in this le to other ports to avoid collision.
You also need to de ne a debug port (that isn't the default 8000), both in the 'run-tomcat' task in the

tasks.json le, and in the matching launch con guration in the launch.json le, which are all associated with
the same run con guration.
You can modify the content of this directory to con gure Tomcat as desired for this run con guration. For example, you
can add libraries to be used at runtime or change ports. For more information, see Apache Tomcat

.

Binding Process
Not all of the services that you want to bind to are publicly exposed. Therefore, we must use a secure tunnel to access them
from Cloud Foundry.
When binding to one of these services, we use chisel

to open a secure channel to your Cloud Foundry space.

A new task is created within the binding step to run chisel. Run this task before running the con guration.
The environment con guration le is updated with the chisel and the selected service parameters.
The Tomcat con guration les are updated according to the chosen service.

MTA Editor
The visual MTA editor allows you to edit the MTA descriptor (the mta.yaml le located in the root project folder) using tables
and forms instead of the text-based code editor.
The multitarget application (MTA) descriptor contains the metadata of all entities comprising an application or used by it during
deployment or runtime, and the dependencies between them.
The MTA descriptor is automatically generated when an application project is created from scratch, and it is updated when the
project properties change or when a module is added or removed. However, not all the necessary information can be generated
automatically. You need to maintain the descriptor manually to de ne resources, properties, and dependencies, as well as ll in
missing information.
The MTA descriptor is written in the YAML format, which has strict syntax requirements. You can edit the descriptor in the textbased code editor, but we recommend you use the visual MTA editor. The visual MTA editor allows you to easily navigate
between the objects in the mta.yaml le and helps you avoid dealing with the complex and sensitive syntax of YAML les.
To open the visual MTA Editor:
1. Right-click the desired mta.yaml le.
2. Choose

Open With

MTA Editor .

 Note
The visual MTA editor removes comments and formats the le. If you want to add comments, use the code editor. To open
the code editor, double-click on the desired mta.yaml le or right-click the le and choose

Open With

Code Editor .

If you edit the le with the code editor, it is important to use spaces rather than tabs for indentation.

Develop an App Using Diﬀerent Subaccounts
You can develop your application with diﬀerent subaccounts. You use one subaccount to create and run your application in SAP
Business Application Studio. You use the other subaccount, in a diﬀerent region, to deploy your application to Cloud Foundry.
This scenario is useful in the following situations:
You're using a single development subaccount to develop many target accounts.
Your development account isn't in the same region as your target account.
Develop an app with two subaccounts as follows:
1. From your global account in the SAP BTP cockpit, create two subaccounts in two diﬀerent regions. See Create a
Subaccount [Feature Set B].
One subaccount is for the design time environment and the other is for the runtime environment.
2. Complete the following steps in the design time subaccount:
a. Add the relevant SAP Business Application Studio service plan. See Con gure Entitlements and Quotas from Your
Subaccount.
b. Subscribe to SAP Business Application Studio.
3. Navigate to the Overview page of your runtime subaccount and click Enable Cloud Foundry. This enables you to deploy
the application to Cloud Foundry. See Create Orgs.
4. If you're using an external data source (outside SAP BTP) for your application, create the same destination, with the
same name, in both subaccounts. See Create HTTP Destinations and Add a System.
5. Log in to Cloud Foundry. Make sure to update the Cloud Foundry endpoint with the region of the runtime subaccount (for
example, change https://api.cf.us10.hana.ondemand.com to

https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com).
6. Create a Project in the design time subaccount. Make sure to connect to the relevant destination during data source and
service selection.

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit the SAP Help Portal

138

5/19/2023

7. Test your application by creating a run con guration. Make sure to bind the relevant destination.
8. Build and deploy your application.
Your application uses the runtime subaccount to deploy to Cloud Foundry.

Extend SAPUI5 Applications
You can extend SAPUI5 applications that reside remotely on the on-premise SAPUI5 ABAP repository.

Prerequisites
Activate the /sap/bc/adt and the /sap/bc/ui2/app_index/ services in your back end.
Make sure you have con gured the connectivity to your ABAP system as described in Connecting to External Systems.

Procedure
1. Migrate your extension project from SAP Web IDE.
See Migrate an Extension Project from SAP Web IDE.
2. (Optional) Use source control, such as Git, to maintain your extension project source code.
You must use the extension project source code to preview the extension project and add more extensions to it.
See Git Source Control.
3. Add an extension, such as a view or controller extension, to the extension project. See Create New Extensions.
4. Preview your extension project locally in the SAP Business Application Studio workspace.

 Note
When extending a project, compatibility issues may arise between the original and the extended project. For more
information, see Caveats Regarding Stability Across Application Upgrades.

 Note
The SAPUI5 ABAP repository is based on the BSP repository of the ABAP Server. The BSP repository is used only as a
repository or storage for SAPUI5 application les. However, BSP server-side processing is not used at runtime and
therefore the ow logic of ABAP parts cannot be used, since they are not executed at runtime.

Development Actions after Migration
You can add extensions, preview, and deploy. See Extend SAPUI5 Applications for more information.

Create New Extensions
Extensions enable you to change the views or the logic of an extended project.

Prerequisites
You migrated an extension project.

Context
You can create extensions to:
Replace an existing view with a new view in an existing project.
Add logic to an existing view using an extension point that is de ned in the original project.
Change control visibility.
Extend an existing controller with new logic.
Implement a UI controller hook with new logic.
Customize the strings of the original application.
Once the extensions have been created, a reference to them is created in the Component.js/manifest.json le of the
extended project.

 Note
If you delete or rename a le that is referenced from the component.js/manifest.json le, the application does not
work properly. Make sure that you delete the reference or update the le name on the component.js/manifest.json
le as well.

Extend Controllers
You can extend a controller of the original application by replacing it with an empty controller or with a copy of the
original controller. You can also implement UI controller hooks if they are provided by the original application. Once one of
these controllers is in place, you can customize it as needed.
Extend Views
You can extend a view using an extension point.
Hide Controls
You can hide a speci c control of the original application.
Edit Strings
The i18n Resource Text Customization extension allows you to copy the i18n folder of the original application to your
extended application. This allows you to edit the UI strings in the extended application without altering the original
application.
Replace Views
You can replace a speci c view in an original application with a new view.
