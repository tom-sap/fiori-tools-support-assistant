    Question Body: 
            I recently converted my application to MTA. 
When I try to deploy it to CF I get the following error: 
sh: 1: fiori: not found 
I tried adding "npx" to the start script resulting in this error message: 
npm ERR! 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/fiori - Not foundnpm ERR! 404 'fiori@latest' is not in this registry. 
How can I start my application without it crashing?

 Can we develop tablet/ mobile based Fiori application without using BTP based "Mobile services" or AppGyver? 
Any way to develop it offline and upload to mobile (like .apk)

    Answer is: SAP Fiori is bound to the SAP ecosystem. You may however look into OpenUI5. Open-Source components published by SAP can applied like so for instance. There are also some older threads about Cordova and OpenUI5. You may get more inspiration for your endeavaour there.

    Question Title: SAP Fiori Application Model - Page Map not loading
    Question Body: 
            Hi together, 
I have a Fiori Elements app in front of a CAP service. For the Fiori Elements part I use the SAP Fiori Tools: Application Modeler. Today I want to open the page my in the application modeler, but it was not working, the screen stayed blank. 
 An error message occured. Entry not found (FileSystemError) <projectpath>/app/test/src/app.json 
I think this file don't exists before the error occured. 
In addition I found a note https://me.sap.com/notes/3193311, but the described resolution is not working for me. 
, 

        
    Answer is: Hi ,
a new version of https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-specification was released which should fix your issue (it was an "endless" loop during project parsing). You can install the new version with the application info page for your project under "Status" sections. The info page can be accessed either by right-click context menu of the project, the Application Modeler tree view or the palette command "Fiori: Open Application Info". Please test whether it resolve the problem.

I am just confused how to select the available UI5 version.
        
    Answer is: Hi ,the root cause was the missing support for the HEAD request type which we are using to ping for the existence of the UI5 version. This should have been fixed on UI5 CDN now. Please try again.Best ,

    Question Body: 
            Hi there, 
Is there a way to preserve line breaks for attributes in the SAP Fiori Tools XML Annotation Server XML Formatting? 
Currently, it's changing this

    Answer is:   Mok Kay Wai 
 for bringing this up. SAP Fiori Tools - XML annotation LSP extension is not supposed to format the xml view files. We will exclude formatting of non-annotation or metadata files from this extension so you could use other extensions for this purpose.
If you want to have formatting capabilities in UI5 Language Assistant extension which is also part of SAP Fiori Tools, feel free to request an enhancement here: https://github.com/SAP/ui5-language-assistant/issues

    Question Title: Using 'fiori-tools-proxy' behind a corporate proxy not working properly
    Question Body: 
            Hi everybody, 
currently, the middleware 'fiori-tools-proxy' of @sap/ux-ui5-tooling cannot be used behind an enterprise proxy if the backend is located in the enterprise network and the npm proxy config (HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, NO_PROXY) is set. 
The error is located in the "isHostExcludedFromProxy" function. Here it is checked whether the coporate proxy is necessary for the URL set in UI5.yaml.  
 
In line 107906 a JavaScript URL instance is created from the passed string url (e.g. "https://www.sap.com:443") After that the property "host" is selected from the created instance. However, the host from the URL object is set with port.  
So the endsWith() check in line 107908 is always performed against HOST:PORT. Usually the NO_PROXY environment variable is not set with port, but only the domain is specified. As a result, the function returns 'false' and the proxy is wrongly set for the internal URL. 
Workaround, so that it works anyway: 
1. Delete environment variable (HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, NO_PROXY). NPM with default registry will not work anymore. 
2. Add NO_PROXY entry with PORT (*.sap.com:443)

Just recently I've got this error, which was working for me before. 
 
with no other error logs underneath the last line 
/sap/opu/odata/UI5/ABAP_REPOSITORY_SRV SICF Service has already been activated. 
It seems like it's not reaching the backend.

Any ideas?

    Question Title: Exit code 0 even if deploy failed
    Question Body: 
            , 
I'm trying to use fiori-tools in our CI/CD pipeline to deploy to a Netweaver ABAP stack, but I'm running into issues if the deploy fails. If the deploy fails I want the deploy step in our pipeline to also fail, but today the deploy-to-abap task exits with exit code 0 even if the deploy step fails. I expected it to exit with a non-zero code. 
Without this it is impossible to use the deploy task in a CI/CD pipeline, since it quietly fails. 
I get the same behaviour both in BAS and Bitbucket pipelines.

    Answer is:  ,
Yes, for CI/CD pipelines the deploy exit code is always 0, this is something we are updating. As a workaround, could you use the fail fast option (with the -f flag) as follows:

    Answer is: Hi, 
At least for now, Adaptation Project extension is intended for usage only in SAP Business Application Studio and NOT in VSCode. We will definitely update the contents of the readme of the extension to mention this in order to avoid any further confusion. 
It will be in future available for usage in VSCode, as marked in our roadmap: https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?BC=901B0ED1A0641EDAA3F5DF6872FEA0F0⦥=CURRENT-LAST#Q1%202023

    Question Title: SAP Theme Editor & Figma Stencils
    Question Body: 
            Dear community,is there a way to easily export a color theme that was created with SAP Theme editor and use the new colors to apply to Figma?We created a green theme with SAP Theme Designer and want to use these colors in Figma stencils.What is the best / easy how to?!
        
    Answer is: Hi ,  
Unfortunately we do not have a guide for creating custom themes in Figma at this point. We have, however, created all of the theme parameters used in theme designer as styles inside the Quartz Light master Figma file that you referred to.  
 
I would recommend that you cross-check which theme parameters were modified to create your custom theme in the UI theme designer and then try to search for those parameters in the Figma styles. 
 
Then you can search for those parameter names in Figma style and replace the values.  
There is a drawback with Figma because colors of theming parameters in the UI theme designer will be base parameter values for many other style parameters... meaning in theme designer you can set styles to base parameters like "sapbaseColor", "sapBrandColor", sapShellColor, and they will have connections to things like "emphasized button" (brand), "header backgrounds" (base), Home page header bar, (shell color). 
 
But unfortunately with Figma styles, it is not currently possible to connect one style to another style so you would need to change all of those connected styles manually. 
Currently, the only theming guidance we have is this theming overview explanation of how quick and detailed theming works here: 
https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/theming/ 
You can also use the following link to access UI theme designer community for more details on the theming tool... https://community.sap.com/topics/ui-theme-designer 
I hope this makes sense and helps you

    Question Body: 
            , 
I'm building Fiori apps for S4/Hana on premise with the BAS. I've generated an app via the Fiori tools and this one is using a custom control which is develop in an UI5 Library. While launching the app, the library (present as a project in the BAS) can't be retrieved. 
Would you have more info on how to configure the run configuration for this case ? What's the best practices ? I've seen Is there a way to consume custom UI5 library from SAP Business Application Studio? - SAP Q&A but i wish to avoid manual steps when deploying if possible... 
I used to modify the index.html + run config as explained here Using UI5 Libraries in CF approuter | SAP Blogs but it's not working with Fiori tools. 
 
Aurélien
        
    Answer is:  Aurélien, 
in order to be able to load the custom UI5 lib from your workspace, you need to use the fiori-tools-servestatic middleware. Please check the documentation here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-ui5-tooling 
All you need to do is to add the following into the ui5.yaml 
 
- name: fiori-tools-servestatic
    afterMiddleware: compression
    configuration:
      paths:
        - path: /<custom UI5 lib>
          src: "<Path to custom UI5 lib>"

    Question Title: 'Show Page Map' results in "Could not find any SAP Fiori projects in workspace"
    Question Body: 
            Hi s 
Getting below error while extending a standard Fiori elements-based app (App ID F0842A) using an adaptation project in BAS. While using guided development, it shows NO PROJECT. 
 
 
Tried adding sapux details in the package.json. still no success. 

        
    Answer is: You don’t have to use the guided development tooling for adaptation projects. Instead you can use the sapui5 visual editor as described here https://blogs.sap.com/2022/01/26/sap-fiori-elements-adaptation-project-adding-a-custom-filter-to-the-list-report/

            Hi BAS Team 
I've created an Adaptation Project in BAS. When I now try to open the SAPUI5 Visual Editor by doing a right-click on webapp/manifest.appdescr_variant I get the following error message: 
 
 
Any fix for this issue ? 
TA
        
    Answer is: Hi , 
Please check this SAP Knowledge Base Article.
This issue was corrected in the 1.71.43 version, so the system needs to be pointed to this minor version. 
Open the config.json file in .adp folder and replace sapui5 entry with the below;
{      "name": "sapui5",      "url": http://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/1.71.43}
Btw, you can also navigate to the visual editor via the command palette, just search for Open SAPUI5 Visual Editor.

    Question Title: CAP and Kyma Tutorial: fiori add deploy-config cf failing
    Question Body: 
            Hi,i am following tutorial Deploy Your CAP Application on SAP BTP Kyma Runtime - Prepare SAP Launchpad Service Setup.In step 5, fiori add deploy-config cf is giving error. The error is "This Fiori application is within a CAP project and deployment should be configured as part of the CAP project."does this mean some files are missing ?
        
    Answer is: Hi there,
This error is returned when the deploy config logic cannot find an MTA in the root of the CAP project. The mta.yaml file needs to be present so that the Fiori application deploy config can be added. Can you please ensure you have an mta.yaml in your CAP project?

I have a requirement where to scan the below Barcodes using UI5 application in a tablet, I tried using BarcodeScannerButton and I was able to scan the Barcodes one by one, but the issue is I do have multiple bar codes in a single sheet and is it possible to scan all the Barcodes in one go? 
 
 & , 
.
        
    Answer is: Hi     ,It is definitely not possible with the BarcodeScannerButton.Here you have to write an implementation yourself, e.g. with zxing-js (UI5 uses the same library) and ui5-tooling-modules.Here is a example to read multiple QR Codes:ZXing._decode_qr_multi(decodePtr)

note: in my organization there are Three systems are maintaining (Development, Quality, Production ) along Fiori Development and Fiori Production. 
Thank you/.
        
    Answer is: Just refer to the SAP Fiori Apps Reference Library, locate the standard Fiori apps you want to use and ensure that the required components are installed in your system. Then, refer the Implementation Information -> Configuration section for the app(s) and activate the required SAPUI5 app(s) and OData service(s), assign the required business roles and test the Fiori apps from teh Fiori Launchpad.

    Question Title: VS code ui5 generator
    Question Body: 
            Hi all, I am getting started with UI5 in VS code. I used Fiori: Open Application Generator to create a project from a template, I selected SAPUI5 freestyle-> SAPUI5 Application->Data source None, view name and finish. 
Now just to check, I ran the application. I saw the following.  
 
And when I pressed the SAP logo, It redirected me to this page. 
 
I wanted to create a clean Application. How do I remove the Sample Applications and have only My app?
        
    Answer is: Hi ,
If you are using VS Code then I'm assuming you are using UI5 tooling package and Yo generator. After you create freestyle project you should run the application as index.html. What you must be doing rigth now is running with on sandbox fiori launchpad. Use: -
ui5 serve 
To run the server.

    Question Title: Passing options to Yeoman Fiori Elements (@sap/fiori) Generator
    Question Body: 
            Has anyone experience with integrating the @sap/fiori yeoman generator into a custom yeoman generator? 
I can't find any documentation on passing options to the generator, e.g. preselecting SAP Fiori Elements as application type. Passing applicationType: "SAPUI5 freestyle" or "SAP Fiori elements" does not work. It always presents me with the selection.
        
    Answer is: Hi   
Thank you for your query. Unfortunately the SAP Fiori generator doesn't currently support partial filling of values. We do, however, support a headless mode where the user passes in the full payload to the generator, but all mandatory values have to be provided at that point. 
Using standard yeoman execution passing the path to the application configuration json file as the first argument.
yo @sap/fiori:headless <path-to-app-config> <optional-output-path> <options>
Options:
--force : Overwrite the output files
--skipInstall: Skip the install phase
--delete: Delete the input app configuration file
Sample Usage:
yo @sap/fiori:headless sample.json ./test/test-output --skipInstall
And here is a sample JSON file: sample.xml (rename to be sample.json)
We are currently in the process of moving functionality from the Fiori generator to the open source community, and once that is all done, there may be an option to support partial values.

    Question Title: Change default browser used by VSCode/Fiori Tools ?
    Question Body: 
            
 
 
  Hi,
  Has anyone found a nice way to change the default browser used by VSCode with Fiori Tools ?
  I am using MacOS with default browser as Safari which I'd prefer to keep it this way. For development purposes I like to use Chrome specifically and currently I'm just changing this manually after launching by copying the URL into Chrome. From VSCode documentation it suggests this is done via .vscode/.launch.json file as per the following: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/browser-debugging
  Since Fiori Tools is using type "node" here in the configuration this doesn't look like it will work as suggested so it would likely need to be a change in tools somewhere. Other suggestions are to use an environment variable but I haven't had much luck in getting that working either so thought I'd try the community.
  .

    Answer is: Hi , for pointing that out, the preview indeed is fixed to use the default browser as of today. Your request sounds reasonable I'll take it to the backlog.Best ,

    Question Title: How to create an entry form using "Form Entry Object Page"?
    Question Body: 
            
 
 
  Hi experts,
  In Business Application Studio, there is a Fiori application template called "Form Entry Object Page".
  The title sounds like we can create a form for creating a new record.
  
  I tried to generate a form entry object page based on an existing CAP project (link to git repo).
  As a result, manifest.json was filled with the following routing configuration. 
  "routing": {
	"routes": [{
		"pattern": "Travel({key}):?query:",
		"name": "TravelObjectPage",
		"target": "TravelObjectPage"
	}, {
		"pattern": "Travel({key})/to_Booking({key2}):?query:",
		"name": "BookingObjectPage",
		"target": "BookingObjectPage"
	}],
  The first route requires Travel entity's key, meaning that the entity has to be already exist before showing on the object page. If I enter the hash "#Travel(1)", then it opens with data and edit capability but this is not what I intend.
  
  So my question is, if "Form Entry Object Page" can be used for data creation scenario and if yes, how we can configure the app to behave that way.
  Best ,
  Mio 
 

        
    Answer is: Hi Mio ,you tried creating it for Travel entity which is likely not create enabled. When you do the same for Bookings, you get a create page, you can enter missing value and a draft is saved.      "routes": [        {          "pattern": "Booking({key}):?query:",          "name": "BookingObjectPage",          "target": "BookingObjectPage"        }      ], However I don't have the actual "Save" option on the footer bar, also likely because the service was not meant for creation, but I will check with my colleagues. The key in this case has to be defined as auto-generated by the data model, or else you would be asked to input a key in a popup before you can enter data.Actually the form entry page template is very simple, it creates an app with one single object page, and opens it with "action=create". The problem is, that this does not work well without context, that means embedded in a workflow or otherwise edit/list case.I would recommend to work with the classic List report Object page pattern, which shows you the list on first screen, the details and edit option on the second, and the create button for create mode object page on the list report. I tested this with the TechEd service but I get an error on "Go" for the list report on bookings. As said no fault by the authors, as the service was not designed for it, but will check whether it's an easy fix.Best ,

We have maintained cloud-connector and destination, hence application is working fine when we run the app in BAS preview, and we are able to access backend OData services.  
In the ui5-deploy.yaml file, required settings have been maintained as per the below document.

First error we get is "Request failed with status code 400". BAS is trying to reach our backend ECC server and deployment gets failed. 
Below is the error details we are facing.

This won't fit in BAS.  
I have wrapped some folders under webapp folder and I have added xs-app.json file, package.json file and ui5.yaml file but still doesn't work.  
What am I missing?.

Javier
        
    Answer is: Hi Javier,
In general, I would recommend that you migrate your project using the migration tool SAP Fiori tools provide.
Please see the details here https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/70d41f3ee29d453a90efab3ce025d450.html
Having said that, I also noticed that in your particular snapshot, you do not have webapp folder. We are planning to enhance our support for these kind of projects for migration which will require minimum manual changes. Will it be ok for you to open an incident with us (CA-UX-IDE) so that we can look into your scenario a bit more in detail?
Not sure what you meant by "This won't fit in BAS." though..

    Question Title: How to deploy a CAP Fiori App from VSCode into  Foundry?
    Question Body: 
            , 
I have created a simple CAP app (db + service) in VSCode and deployed it to  Foundry. 
It works in the hybrid mode - I have deployed it and I can post some data to HANA  from my localhost. 
This is on branch initial_hybrid_mode of the repo: 
https://github.com/boolan/carget.git 
Now I would like to add a Fiori app to this CAP project and deploy it to  Foundry. 
I want to use the managed app router and launchpad on CF. 
What are the necessary steps to achieve that?  
Is there any blog or tutorial which covers this scenario step by step? 
Can I use standard Fiori Tools available in VSCode? 
If yes, then what is the correct order of actions? 
How should the mta.yaml look like? 
I did the following: 
1. Generated a Fiori Elements app: 
 
 
 
 
and here comes the first question: 
what is this destination for? 
 
 
2. In the manifest.json file of the app I have added the sap.cloud section: 
 
3. Next, I Changed HTML5Runtime_enabled to true in mta.yaml for the app destination: 
 
4. According to one of the tutorials I should here add 3 destinations for the Launchpad service, but I have no idea, what the syntax is - so I DID NOT DO THIS STEP. 
Probably these should be: 
<appname>-app-srv , <appname>-html5-repo-host and <appname>-uaa  
Are there any code generators for that in VSCode? 
5. I have changed the directory to my sapui5 app directory and executed the command: 
fiori add deploy-config cf 
I was then asked again about a destination, but I have no idea what kind of destination that should be and for what purpose. 
I have provided the same destination as in the deployment configuration during initial app generation: 
 
The result is on the branch: add_fiori_elements_app of 
https://github.com/boolan/carget.git 
Did I miss any steps? 
Should anything be added manually to the mta.yaml?

    Question Title: FE Mockserver - Handling URL Parameters
    Question Body: 
             Dears,I am new in Fe Mock Server.Currently, I am in step of preparing mockdata, but I noticed one issue when URL contain additional parameters like filter.When URL contains additional parameters, empty data is returned, mock data file is ignored.  
All works when there is no additional params in URL 
 
Could somebody help me to understand how to handling URL params in right way?I have even tried to create a file which include url params in filter, but it didn't help: 

        
    Answer is: Hi,
The mockserver is maintained at https://github.com/SAP/open-ux-odata. The repository contains not just the sources but also samples and documentation. I would recommend to have a look at the basic usage example at https://github.com/SAP/open-ux-odata/tree/main/samples/basic-usage.
Specifically about your question, you don't need to do anything to handle the url parameters, the mockserver does it for you. In your example the url parameter contains a filter for elements with Status = Open and MyDeal = X. If you maintain your mockdata then you need to make sure that you have entries in your mockdata that match this filter (if you want something returned when doing the call above).
When it comes to maintaining mockdata, it is, of course, possible to directly manipulate the json files, however, since you are new to the topic, I would recommend to use the SAP Fiori Tools (https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools). They contain an extension called "Data Editor" allowing you to maintain the mockdata.
Cheers,

    Question Body:

I'm trying to deploy to a Fiori application in our CI/CD pipeline (Bitbucket). However I need to specify a transport request in ui5.yaml to deploy my applicationI want this to be dynamic, if a transport request exist it should use it, otherwise create a new one. I have tried using the CM Service from Project Piper in my pipeline, but there I cannot query for an existing transport, only create new ones. 
        
    Answer is: Currently there is no such step available to list open transport requests.I recommend to use the step transportRequestUploadCTS, put the Transport Request ID into the git commit message and use the step transportRequestReqIDFromGit to look it up.

  Hey s,
  I'm getting a little frustraded right now because I just can't get it to work.I'm trying to use a UI5 custom control in BAS which I installed with npm.I can see it in the `resource` folder when i build it. I can use it when i run it locally with VS Code.
  So my guess is the YAML configuration in BAS.
  I see in the log in BAS that it tries to pull from the UI5 resource the custom control: 
  /1.96.6/resources/ui5-isu/customControl/excelUpload/ExcelUpload.js
  How can I avoid this?What else can i try? ( to only use VS Code is unfortunately not an option )
  I created a simple sample app with the same error: marianfoo/ui5-consumenpm-test (github.com)

    Question Title: sap:display-format="Date" correct but output in list report still wrong ?
    Question Body: 
            
 
 
  Good day,
  I have read literally dozens of posts on the subject regarding edm.DateTime format issues but I am still none the wiser and unsure of my options - there are just too many circumstances. I am building list report application with object page using Fiori Tools in VSCode and Fiori Elements. I have created my own ABAP CDS view with annotations in backend which is using ABAP 7.5 unfortunately so I have to work around the limitations.
  In my metadata file the "Logindate" property is showing as correct SAP display format: 
  <Property Name="Logindate" Type="Edm.DateTime" Precision="0" sap:display-format="Date" sap:label="Login Date"/> 
  But list report output is as below:
  
  SAP output:
  
  Odata output: 
  <d:Logindate>2022-11-16T00:00:00</d:Logindate>
  What is my best option here to format the date correctly so it only displays the date and does not include time/timezone ? 
  Appreciate your advice.

    Answer is: I found the problem.@ObjectModel.text.element was set on the lineItem. After removing this all is good:My fault ;-)

    Question Title: Passing parameters while intent-based navigation in Fiori List Report
    Question Body: 
            In my list report, when I click directly on the 'Business Partner' field it opens 'Maintain Business Partner' app, but doesn't pass the value. 
 
Is there a way to pass the business partner value to other app?
        
    Answer is: It appears that the target mapping for BusinessPartner-maintain might not be correct. 
You could try creating your own target mappnig and change the parameter target for BusinessPartner to to BUS_JOEL_SEARCH-PARTNER_NUMBER instead of BUS_JOEL_MAIN-CHANGE_NUMBER
Then update your semanticObjectAction to use your new target mapping instead.

    Question Title: Proxy WS Requests from BAS to On-Premise system
    Question Body: 
            Hi everyone, 
I'm currently struggling to create a working WebSocket connection from BAS (BTP) to an On-Premise SAP System. I want to start the application during development and not only have valid OData requests but also a live WebSocket connection to the On-Premise backend. There isn't any application router or anything like that, just a simple UI5 app running through the FLP sandbox during development. 
The "/SAP/BC/APC" path + all sub-paths, is maintained and (Active + WebSocket Upgrade option flagged as described here: https://btp.udina.de/development/websocket.html#cloud-to-on-premise-access-control-ressources - can also be seen in "more official" BAS related docs) within the  Connector. 
When the app itself is deployed on the target system, opening the App from within the system using WebSockets works, but when it is to be routed through the UX Tools Proxy Middleware this is not the case and it err's out with:  
 
The OData connections work flawlessly and I'm able to work with them without any issue, only when trying to use WebSockets it seem to cause this. According to this: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-ui5-tooling#proxying-websockets - it looks pretty straight forward. You just enable the WebSocket proxying by setting "ws" to true + have the  Connector maintained accordingly.  
Of course within the On-Premise system the ICF paths are also active but it doesn't even get that far from what I can tell. 
I'm running the latest version of "@sap/ux-ui5-tooling" which is 1.7.6 at the time of asking this question. The "customMiddleware" section for the "fiori-tools-proxy" looks like this: 
 
Not sure what I'm missing here. Any Ideas, hints or pointers are greatly appreciated! :) 
Note:  
There is a similar, if not exact same question here, sadly without answer: https://answers.sap.com/questions/13518750/establish-websocket-connection-to-on-premise-syste.html
        
    Answer is: Well ... according to the incident I raised, this scenario is currently not supported by SAP. Sadly this is nowhere mentioned in the documentation, which is even sadder, as the "ux-ui5-tooling" is supposed to be the go-to tooling for UI5 development, especially when you're in BAS (at least that's one reason it is used as preset for booting up a Dev. environment, isn't it?).
I was offered to mail someone from SAP to ask for this feature. Not sure where we go from here or how fast that'd be added. For now I guess a deployment is necessary whenever we want to test something regarding the WebSocket implementation/usage.

    Question Title: Preview a UI5 application with Steampunk backend on Mac OS
    Question Body: 
            I want to develop a UI5 application with a Steampunk Backend. To do this I have set the option scp: true in the Fiori-tools-proxy 
In windows this works perfectly fine. I have to logon in SAP universal ID and then the data flows :) 
With my Mac unfortunately this is not the case. Is there something to configure to make it work with a Mac? 
This is my ui5.yaml:

 backend: 
 - path: /sap 
 url: my-steampunk-system 
 scp: true
        
    Answer is: I was able to solve the problem on my own.
To make it work I had to add the steampunk system via the command "Fiori: Add SAP System".

    Question Title: CAP CDS projects in VSCode - Service Manager Extension error "No applications found"
    Question Body: 
            We have several CAP CDS projects which are giving the following error in VSCode when we attempt to access the "Service Manager" extension to refresh the metadata.xml under /localService ("No applications found"). These are MTA projects, and up to a certain point (we do not know exactly when) this error started to occur when accessing the Service Manager. The original project structure did not do this, so it's likely a change introduced at some point in the last 6 weeks of development. However, is it possible to ascertain the actual cause of the error? This may even be an issue with the recent Fiori plugins and JSON schema versions of manifest.json, but we're not able to reproduce it consistently. What we know is as follows: 
* We have 4 apps in the MTA. 2 UI5 freestyle and 2 Fiori Elements apps. 
* The error does not affect other "app scanning" extensions, such as the Application Info extension which lists all apps and works OK. 
* The Service Manager does open if we add a fresh UI5 Freestyle app to the MTA project. It does not work for Fiori elements apps we add. Not does it work for existing UI5 freestyle apps in the MTA project, even though originally it did. 
* When we use the Service Manager in BAS, we get no error - nothing happens. 
* We can see no related errors in any console outputs 
Help appreciated! 
        
    Answer is: Hi ,
There has been various updates to Service Manager recently. One of those changes was to exclude Fiori projects in CAP CDS projects from the projects listed.Normally in this scenario these Fiori application projects use cds file for annotations so do not have the metadata.xml or annotation xml file in the localService folder. Service Manager is of no use as it only refreshes the xml odata file for the service. 
If you prefer to use xml files only in the Fiori application and sync the metadata with the CAP service I would suggest moving the Fiori apps outside the CAP project structure.
If you could share details of your folder structure and sapux values from the CAP root package.json that would be helpful to better understand.
If you prefer to log a support issue and share the projects as a zip that could be easier.

    Question Title: BAS/VSC Fiori Tools and CAP ODATA v2 proxy
    Question Body: 
             there, 
maybe someone can help me with the following issue. 
We are creating an CAP application in which we have to use the ODATA v2 proxy.We also have create some Fiori pages on the v2 services. 
So far so good. 
But when we now what to use the Fiori Extentions in BAS/VSC for this Fiori apps we are getting an error when loading the apps. 
A temporary solution is to change the CAP Service path according to the generated v2 path from the proxy: 
@path : '/monitor_v2'service monitor_v2 { 
Change to 
@path : '/v2/monitor_v2'service monitor_v2 { 
Now the Fiori tools are working again but we have to change it back before we start the CAP application because the prefix /v2 is used by the odata v2 proxy. 
 

        
    Answer is: Hi ,
SAP Fiori tools currently only supports V4 based service based apps inside CAP projects. Please refer to the documention here https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/99061814ead548808d539861fb27bafb.html?q=cap%20v2#use-a-local-cap-project
It is recommended to create the V2 based app as a separate project outside the CAP project.

    Answer is: I found a solution:
In the webapp folder of the UI Modules in the manifest i had to change srv-api/box-rent to box-rent.The tool will not find this path because it represents the path for the approuter not the local path.Dont forget to reverse the change otherwhise the app will not work when deployed or in hybrid mode.

    Question Title: Fiori Barcode Scanner Not available
    Question Body: 
            Dear All 
I am using SAP UI5 version 1.84.6 with library "sap.ndc". 
When I am running the Fiori Application through personal WEB IDE, on Chrome and Edge browsers, its opening laptop camera and also able to scan the barcode. Whereas after deploying the same Fiori App on ERP Server having higher UI5 version i.e., 1.84.6 as compared to personal web ide UI5 version (1.71.46), App is giving message "Scanner is not Available" 
I have also checked the SAP Note 2402585 - sap.ndc.BarcodeScannerButton in Fiori. 
As per above mentioned Note, Scanning is supported using the browser as of SAPUI5 minimum versions 1.92, SAPUI5 1.84.18, SAPUI5 1.71.47, and later supported SAPUI5 versions. 
However, in my case Barcode scanning is working only when running the Fiori App locally on Personal Webide without deploying it on server.
        
    Answer is: As Wu already mentioned and as you actually also already mentioned by repeating SAP Note 240258 "scanning is supported using the browser as of SAPUI5 minimum versions [...] SAPUI5 1.84.18" and as your SAP system is only on SAPUI5 1.84.6 this functionality is not available.So you have to upgrade your system to SAPUI5 1.84.18 or higher to solve you issue. My recommendation to you would be not only to upgrade to SAPUI5 1.84.18 (as this version is also already quite old) but just to the latest patch version of SAPUI5 1.84.Check out SAP Note 2912791 to figure out which SAPUI5 1.84 patch comes with which SAP_UI 755 patch (there you can see that SAPUI5 1.84.18 comes with SAP_UI 7.55 SP05). I also recommend SAP Note 3155948 explaining how to upgrade to a higher patch level of installed SAPUI5 version in an ABAP system.

    Answer is: Hi     ,
You can do this in many ways based on the scenario. It's question of validation. On any business case you should have a validation at the client-side and server-side to ensure data quality.
Here in your example, the table is backed by a JSONModel, hence you can add validation in the onAdd function to see if already exists in the model.
if(isValid(nObject)){     oModelData.push(nObject);}

    Question Title: Development tools / SAP Business Application Studio
    Question Body: 
            Hi Everybody 
I would like to know if SAP Business Application Studio can be used to develop CDS views. 
If no, is there any full stack development tool/platform which may be used as well for CDS views, UI5, (and why not ABAP too !) and can manage git integration too for collaborative work 
At my level of knlowledge it seems that we can use 
 
 Eclipse/SAP Hana Studio for CDS views 
 SAP Web Ide / SAP Business application Studio for UI5 (Fiori application for example) 
 SAP Gui for ABAP 
 
We are moving to S4 Hana and I would rather develop in one or two single tool 
Thank you in advance, 
Best , 
Joëlle
        
    Answer is: When you are saying "CDS Views" you mean ABAP CDS views, correct?For ABAP CDS view and ABAP development you can use Eclipse (with installed ABAP Development Tools). You do not need old SAP GUI editors for that anymore, respectively some new artifacts are not supported by SAP GUI editors. Git for ABAP development can be used using abapGit (just search for it, there are lot of posts and references for that). For UI5/SAP Fiori development you can use Business Application Studio or e.g. Visual Studio Code. For Visual Studio code the Fiori Tools Extension pack is available in the extension store (including a lot of editors, tooling, etc supporting you in Fiori development). In both environments Git support is integrated out of the box.

    Question Title: Load local UI5 library while using fiori-tools-proxy
    Question Body: 
            Hi everyone, 
I have a similar question to Fiori Tools - fiori-tools-proxy - Direct load & fiori-tools-servestatic issue in BAS | SAP Community. 
I'm using the "fiori-tools-proxy" to serve (& preview) the LTS UI5 version "1.71.XX" within an FLP Sandbox. 
When adding a custom library, for example the promisified V2 OData Model from Mauricio via npm (both normal dependency and "ui5" + adding it into the manifest under "libs". I'm facing the issue that, due to the aforementioned "fiori-tools-proxy" usage and it's proxying of the UI5 resources, I end up getting requests to "https://ui5.sap.com/1.71.33/resources/openui5/model/odata/v2/library.js" which obviously does not exist there. 
 
The app preview is run via the command "fiori run → start" with the flpSandbox.  
 
When running it locally (start-local), without proxying, it works however, I don't want to run it fully on local resources as the earliest version I can get here is "1.76.XX" and not the LTS "1.71.XX" version. Arguably this doesn't make too much of a difference and one could neglect that in theory. 
I've also tried to use the Serve Static without success though. I thought I should be able to somehow add another proxy for anything going against "/resources/openui5" to load from my local resources. Maybe I need to go an old route and add/map this to the "resources" folder myself in this scenario? 
If there is anything missing to better understand the question, please let me know. Any help or pointers are much appreciated!  
Edit: ui5.yaml used to run the flpSandbox with it's proxying to ui5.sap.com: (I had to put it as screenshot in order to not fight with the editor here which messed up the syntax highlighting and formatting ...) 
 
Here a version without any "insert Code" (for copy&paste): 
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/schema/ui5.yaml.json specVersion: "2.5"metadata: name: some.namespace.projecttype: applicationbuilder: customTasks: - name: ui5-task-transpile afterTask: replaceVersion configuration: debug: true removeConsoleStatements: true transpileAsync: trueserver: customMiddleware: - name: ui5-middleware-simpleproxy afterMiddleware: compression mountPath: /resources/openui5 configuration: baseUri: "https://localhost:8080/resources" - name: fiori-tools-appreload afterMiddleware: compression configuration: port: 35729 path: webapp delay: 300 - name: fiori-tools-proxy afterMiddleware: ui5-middleware-simpleproxy #compression configuration: ignoreCertError: false # If set to true, certificate errors will be ignored.

Seems like you can import a handler function to filter what requests are proxied.

You can refer to the link below:
https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/d344c5aa5c81483482dbbed5b3abb142.html
The grouping of rows is supported in analytical tables (sap.ui.Table.AnalyticalTable) and responsive tables (sap.m.Table).
Also, just an example code ( you may have to correct if any syntax error)

    Question Title: Dropdown List for one column of a table with Odata binding.
    Question Body: 
            Hi All, 
I have to display a table with three columns, and third column should have value from entityset zentity2 ( ID, Description) 
Entity1 is the actual display of table ( name, flag ,desc{ three values from zentity2 as dropdown}). 
Code in my view 
	<ColumnListItem>
									<cells>
										<ObjectIdentifier text="{name}"></ObjectIdentifier>
										<ObjectIdentifier text="{flag}"></ObjectIdentifier>
										<ObjectIdentifier text="{desc}"></ObjectIdentifier>
										<Text text="{desc}"/>
										<Select items="{entity2}">
											<!-- here's the relative dropdown binding -->
											<core:Item key="{id}" text="{Description}"/>
										</Select>
									</cells>
								</ColumnListItem> 
In My Controller 
 var oModel = new sap.ui.model.json.JSONModel(); 
 oModel.setData(oData); 
 this.getView().setModel(oModel); 
As of now, I see a table with just three columns and no drop down in description column.
        
    Answer is: You need a "/" before the entity2 set, otherwise it thinks entity2 is a property of entity1
<cells>
	<ObjectIdentifier text="{name}"></ObjectIdentifier>
	<ObjectIdentifier text="{flag}"></ObjectIdentifier>
	<Select items="{/entity2set}" selectedKey="{id_in_entity1}">
		<core:Item key="{id}" text="{Description}"/>
	</Select>
</cells><br>

    Question Title: Problem connecting to ABAP on-premise system - ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID
    Question Body: 
            , 
After installing the VS extensions I try to create a new project using the Template Wizard but during Data Source configuration step I cannot connect to the ABAP on-prem system.  
The returned error is A connection error occurred, please ensure the target host is available on the network: "http code: ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID" 
I also tried adding the SAP system in the Fiori Tools but while testing the connection it returns error: 
Hostname/IP does not match certificate's altnames: Host: <removed>. is not in the cert's altnames: DNS:<removed>  
I am able to run deployed apps from browser and also we can test them using customMiddleware.  
At this moment the workaround is to generate the app in WebIDE, download the zip and then add it to VS code. There I am adding the package.json and ui5.yaml files and can test the app.  
But I would like to be able to generate the app directly from VS Code.  
 for any inputs! 
, 

        
    Answer is: Hi there, 
It looks like the https certificate is not valid, and hence the SAP Fiori generator is not able to handshake and request the service data during generation. We have documented a process around how users can install the relevant security certificate themselves. Please see https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/4b318bede7eb4021a8be385c46c74045.html?locale=en-US for more details? You will have to ensure that the certificate is valid before it can be used in the Generator.

    Question Title: Sidebar with Checkboxes in SAPUI5. Is it possible?
    Question Body: 
            ! 
Is there a way to place a sidebar next to the main content in SAPUI5 and fill them with Checkboxes, Comboboxes, ...? 
Something like that: 
 
Left: main content 
Right: Sidebar 
Can you provide me some documentations and informations how I can implement this. I tried it with the NavigationSidebar from tnt, but I can't insert Checkboxes there, only NavigationItems. 
Is there a workaround? It should also be responsive. 
Kind  

        
    Answer is:   , 
You should use a layout control you can try :  
https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/entity/sap.ui.layout.HorizontalLayout/sample/sap.ui.layout.sample.HorizontalLayout 
Then inside this layout you can divide the content into sections via VBox-es, HBox-es or even Vertical Layouts. Your question is very generic and it's better to play with those options so you can choose the one that fits you best.

    Question Body: 
            I am creating a Fiori App , and When i try to create a new file for Annotation Modeler , I don't see the "Annotation File " Option. Picture attached. 
When creating the project, in "Annotation Selection " Folder , I did not select any existing annotation. 
annotations.png
        
    Answer is: Hi ,
if I can see it correctly in your screenshot, you try to generate the annotation file outside of the webapp folder. 
Please generate the annotation file within the webapp or one of its subfolders, as all the code that is related to the application should reside there.
Please let me know if it works for you.

    Question Title: fiori elements image not showing
    Question Body: 
            ,on a ListReport page, I want to place a icon (image) to each line depending on some status value. To do so, I first create the imageURL like this. Please note that I also add @Semantics.imageUrl: true. 
So inside my consumption view, I determine the image url like this 
      case _Status.OrderIsReleased
      when 'X' then 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/White_flag_icon.svg'
      else ''
      end as statusIcon,and I placed semantic infomation to the projection view. I already tried to place everything into the same view with no effect 
 
define root view  entity ZC_abc as projection on ZI_PP_abc {
    key ManufacturingOrder,
    ...,
    ...,
    @Semantics.imageUrl: true
    statusIcon, 
Lastly, I add this to my metadata extension to display the image. 
  @UI.lineItem: [{ position: 10,  label:'', value:'statusIcon', importance: #HIGH }]
 ProductionPlant;

   
In the end, it always displays the image url as string instead of displaying the image itself. What's missing here?

    Question Title: Utilize an approval workflow for supplier and customer master data changes in  
    Question Body: 
            Is there functionality available that allows customers to utilize an approval workflow for supplier and customer master data changes. 
Is there information available on that provides recommended best practice for business partner mast
        
    Answer is: There are 2 approaches:1) in case the organization wants to prevent users from changing master data attributes, they can simply restrict the business roles assigned to the business users to edit/change the master data in accordance with their authorizations decided as per organizational requirements.For customer-supplier master data, there is a restriction type which can be found with the app - 'Display Restriction Types' and freely searching for business partners. The result I found is the restriction type -BEGRU_BUPA_GRP - With this restriction type you control access to business partner data. This is being used by more than 150 business catalogs. Now depending on the business roles you have assigned to your business users you can directly edit the restrictions types by using the app - 'Maintain Business Roles' and controlling the read-write-edit access from here which will control access to change the BPs.2) The SSCUIs for this are (Define Sensitive Fields for Dual Control (Vendors) - SSCUI 102853 ) and (Define Sensitive Fields for Dual Control (Customers) - SSCUI 102852) and can be found in the KBA 3018771 - Sensitive field for customer/vendorAfter setting the fields in the SSCUI(s) as sensitive e.g. if the Bank Account Number field was set as sensitive any change to that field would require a second authorised user to confirm/deny the change. The Apps for confirming the change are called Confirm Customer List and Confirm Supplier List.

    Question Body: 
            Hi all, 
I am fairly new to UI5. I created a project from a template in WebIDE, It was working fine. Then I open the same project in VScode and run it, there was an error stating that "Uncaught ReferenceError: sap is not defined". 
So, what is the issue here? is coding in WebIDE vs VScode differ differently?
        
    Answer is: Hi there,
Can you please confirm that you have the SAP Fiori tools extension pack installed in VSCode? Once this is installed, please restart VSCode. As long as your project is in your workspace folder, the SAP Fiori tools should detect it and prompt you to migrate it to support VSCode. Please see https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/70d41f3ee29d453a90efab3ce025d450.html?locale=en-US for full details.

    Question Title: Not able to migrate Fiori Element v4 based app with SAP Fiori Tools (in VSCode)
    Question Body: 
            Hi Colleagues, 
In our project we are using CAP based services which serves Fiori Element v4 based UI apps. So currently our project folder structure is the following in nutshell: 
app 
 - ui-app1 
 - webapp 
 - package.json 
 - ui5.yaml 
 - ui-app2 (same underlying as in case of app1) 
 - ui-app3 (same underlying as in case of app1) 
srv 
 - ServiceForApp1.cds 
 - ServiceForApp2.cds 
 - ServiceForApp2.cds 
package.json 
I am highlighting these files because based on the migration blog posts these are the most important ones: 
https://blogs.sap.com/2022/01/06/migrate-sap-fiori-projects-from-sap-web-ide-to-sap-business-application-studio/ 
As you can see we have package.json file for each hand crafted ui-apps (created in VSCode, deployed to CF) and also one above them. 
I have already added SAP Fiori Tools extension to VSCode and been able to create a new CAP based project, creating a new ui-app under app folder. So I guess all necessary modules are there in order to use the SAP Fiori Tools migration wizard.  
My goal would be to migrate the not generated ui apps with Fiori Tools extension for VSCode with: "Fiori: Migrate Project for use in Fiori tools" as described here in the official migration guide. 
However when I open it I do no see any element from the list: 
image.png 
I know there is also an option to drag-and-drop the desired ui app but in that case a new window will open only for that ui-app and the main package.json file will be skipped and the migration process could not be started because that file contains the "sapux" property. 
Do you have any suggestion what could be the issue behind this? 
In case Fiori Tools migration wizard tool could not been used to serve my purpose can you highlight the most important files which need to be updated for the not generated ui-app? 
In my PoC branch where I am trying to make this you can check the existing structure also: https://github.tools.sap/epd-specification/specmgmt/pull/2745 
One remark, that with app/ui-maintainphrasecollection somehow I can achieve that can be recognised with Fiori Tools Guided Development and Page Map but not 100% sure what is definitely needed and what is not. 
Many thank for your response in advance! 
Kind , 

        
    Answer is: Hi , 
I can confirm that CAP projects are not supported by the command. "Fiori: Migrate Project for use in Fiori tools" 
and hence not listed. 
I created a small PoC to show how migration could be done manually.  
https://github.tools.sap/epd-specification/specmgmt/compare/main...I058153:main 
Main steps: 
1. Add the entry in the sapux array in the root package.json with the path to the ui application in the app folder.  
E.g 
"sapux":[ 
 "app/ui-compositionitemtype", 
 "app/ui-maintainphrase", 
 "app/ui-specificationtype", 
 "app/ui-compositiongroup", 
 "app/ui-listedsubstance", 
 "app/ui-maintainphrasecollection", 
 "app/ui-compositionitem", 
 "app/ui-listedsubstancegroup", 
 "app/ui-maintainspecification", 
 "app/ui-propertytree" 
 ] 
Note: Do not add the applications using CAP odata v2 these are not currently supported in the integrated CAP folder structure. You can instead open that ui project folder separately in VS Code and it should be recognised by Fiori tools.  
2. Add the following devDependency to the root package.json 
"@sap/ux-specification": "1.100.4" 
3. Remove localUri from the manifest.json datasource as that is only for standalone EDMX / XML. It does not apply to CAP CDS ui5 projects. 
4. Add index.cds to the app folder 
At this stage Fiori tools should work e.g. Page Map, Guide Development, Annotation LSP etc..

            Hi experts. 
I found the issue then i try to deploy sapui5 application to abap system. This issue relevant versions 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 
The error is that archive is empty. And it is really empty. 
 
I try to debug source code and i found that utils_1.ProjectNamespace equal /fiori/cli and in this catalog source files not found for archive. 
 
Maybe someone can help?
        
    Answer is: check this thread. Upload canceled, archive could not be read or appears to be empty | SAP Communitythe deploy script in package.json is the culprit"deploy": "ui5 build preload --clean-dest --config ui5-deploy.yaml --include-task=generateManifestBundle generateCachebusterInfo && rimraf archive.zip",This is wrong. If I just replace it with the below all goes
fine "deploy": "npm run build && fiori deploy --config ui5-deploy.yaml",       Raja

    Question Title: Fiori npm run start, server instantly ends without error
    Question Body: 
            Hi there, 
in past we had success with installing VSCode and Fiori Tools but we discover issues with fresh installation.To test, I installed these versions in this order: 
1. nodejs 16.14.0 with chocolatery2. vscode 1.65.03. SAP Fiori extension Pack v1.6.1 
Now I create a new project based on a simple service provided by our on-premise system. App generator create the project and there are no errors at all. 
However, if I preview the application (npm run start), it starts the local webserver but instantly stops it without any error. In result, we're not able to preview the application.

I also tried to install  
and 
 
without success. Also when enabling verbose logging, nothing gets reported which points to the issue. 
Any ideas why we can't preview the application? 
VSCode 1.65.1nodejs 16.14.0npm 8.5.5SAP Fiori Extension pack 1.6.1 
EDIT: After several tests, I note that the following command fails as the local server instance gets stopped instantly 
npm run start 
whereas this command works. What's the difference here? 
npx fiori run 
EDIT 2: 
I noticed that both commands start the same URL but with different parameter.  
npx fiori run 
starts with parameter sap-iapp-state--history like this 
 
whereas 
npm run start 
doesn't. 

        
    Answer is: Hi,probably some firewall or something like that. Both ui5 serve and fiori command have option --verbose. Have you tried with it to see if there is some useful error message?

    Question Title: Necessary devDepencies for applications package.json file
    Question Body: 
            Hi all, 
I would have a general question. In our project we have just started to try out SAP Fiori tools for Java CAP based project and it seems a really cool extension. 
After generating the app/project folder in the package.json file "devDependencies" property is empty and there is no ui5 related "dependencies" either. 
 
In our hand configured UI project containing the following in the app/project/package.json 
 
My question would be that if we are migrating our hand build UI app to SAP Fiori tools enabled, does these former dependencies will be needed? Or are these should be stored in the root/package.json folder? 
Many , 
Kristóf
        
    Answer is: Hi, 
In theory, the steps should be same as outlined for a NodeJS project in this tutorial https://blogs.sap.com/2022/02/10/build-and-deploy-a-cap-project-node.js-api-with-a-sap-fiori-elements-ui-and-a-managed-approuter-configuration/ 
The sample repo is available at https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-tools-samples/tree/main/cap/cap-fiori-mta 
Based on your configuration, it seems the Fiori UI app was not added to the CAP project. The package.json for the Fiori UI needs a build script and dependencies. 
Run the deploy config command `npm run deploy-config` from the Fioir UI project folder. This will append the necessary config for you.

    Question Title: VSCode: Add Launch Config option is missing in SAP Fiori Tools
    Question Body: 
            Hi guys, before March 2022, when I created application using template generator, the run configurations was created automatically. 
In March these options was not created automatically anymore, so I started to use the option Add Launch Config as showed in image 1 
 
But in April this option is not appearing anymore in SAP Fiori Tools. So I am running command 'npm start' in terminal. Does anyone knows why this option is missing now, and why SAP Fiori Tools is not creating run configurations automatically anymore? 

        
    Answer is: Hi Cristino,
From the screen shot, I also don't see the .vscode folder. Was the project generated without first opening a folder? You can use this command to create run configurations.

Please also see the documentation on this.

    Question Title: Project Management Tool
    Question Body: 
            Hi everyone, 
my company is looking for a project management tool provided by SAP, which can document reports and automate the workflow (notify, task assignment,...). I found the Tool Enterprise Portfolio and Project Management (EPPM), but our projects are usually small and not too complicated, so EPPM is maybe not suitable for our company. 
I would like to know if there are any alternatives that fits our company better or does anyone know how to implement a fiori application for such purpose? 
 & Best , 
 Luc
        
    Answer is: The EPPM Suite (PPM, CPM, and PS) is a full feature solution to portfolio and project management needs.  The use of project management tools also centers around proper accounting of the project.  Is this a concern in your case? Will you be collecting costs and revenues?If you are just looking for checklists and item assignments you should consider CPM which contains checklist functionality and Issue and Change Request management along with document management.  These can be implemented without a cost collecting project.

    Question Title: Fiori Elements Value Help for Enums via annotation
    Question Body: 
            We have a CAP Java project and are building a Fiori Elements UI via CDS annotations. 
We would like to provide a Value Help for one of the filter options on our List Report page. 
The entity looks like this: 
type ChangeEventType : String enum {
 Created;
 Updated;
 Deleted;
};

entity ChangeLogs : cuid {
  occuredAt : Timestamp;
  eventType : ChangeEventType;
...
} 
From my understanding of the documentation (https://github.wdf.sap.corp/pages/cap/advanced/fiori#value-help-support) value help is only supported for Entities or CodeLists. 
How would I add a value help via cds annotations for a type Enum property?
        
    Answer is: Hi Lena, 
For providing a value help in Fiori elements, you always require a ValueList annotation on the corresponding entity property. The ValueList annotation contains property 'CollectionPath' pointing to the values providing entity. So, from a service $metadata perspective, there is no codelist, but entities with properties.In CAP, defining an entity based on aspect CodeList only generates the ValueList annotation for you at CDS compilation, and it also contains the collection path pointing to the codelist based entity that is exposed with the service. 
This gets more clear if you look at the existing ValueList Annotations of your service's metadata.Explanation with example can be found here:https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-elements-feature-showcase/blob/main/README.md#value-help 
For your use case, I would recommend to put an enum typed property inside an aspect of type CodeList (and put a Text with TextArrangment annotation in there so that the name is shown instead of the code), and then use it in an VH entity and for your ChangeLogs entity. 
Like this you get the ValueList Annotation for free. 
You can btw. override the default ValueList Annotation by simply defining it again explicitely. 
Without having tested it, your code would look somthing like this: 
aspect ChangeEvents : CodeList { @( Common : { Text : name, TextArrangement : #TextOnly } ) key code : String enum { Created = 'C'; Updated = 'U'; Deleted = 'D'; }};
entity ChangeEvent: ChangeEvents {};
entity ChangeLogs : cuid, ChangeEvents { occuredAt: Timestamp;}
annotate ChangeLogs with { code @(Common : { Text : name, TextArrangement : #TextOnly, ValueList : { Label : '{i18n>ChangeEvent}', CollectionPath : 'ChangeEvent', Parameters : [ { $Type : 'Common.ValueListParameterInOut', ValueListProperty : 'code', LocalDataProperty : code }, { $Type: 'Common.ValueListParameterDisplayOnly', ValueListProperty: 'name', } ] } });}; 
Hope that helps. 
Best

    Question Title: Fiori App CF Deployment Error: Missing mandatory service instance
    Question Body: 
            Hi all, 
i migrated several Fiori and UI5 apps from the web ide to BAS with the build-in migrate script: "Fiori: Migrate project for use in Fiori tools". 
After the migration i build the mta file and tried to deploy to CF. 
Build and deploy runs with the npm scripts as defined in generated package.json. 
While deploying i got this error: 
[XXX-destination-content] [ERROR] Missing mandatory service instance [XXX-html5-srv] required by destination [XXX_html_repo_host] 
Content deployment for module „XXX-destination-content" to resource „XXX-destination-service" failed: Content deployment for module „XXX-destination-content" failed due to invalid content. Download the logs „XXX-destination-content_XXX-destination-service" via the dmol command and check them for more information. 
Deploying content module „XXX-app-content" in target service „XXX-repo-host"... 
Process failed. 
(i replaced namespace and appname with XXX) 
I tried everything i know. 
Can somebody explain how to fix this? 
 and , 

        
    Answer is: Hi,
From past experience it relates to the length of the service names used during the generation of the mta configuration. Can you confirm you used the Approuter Configuration generator to create an mta.yaml file?
On possible solution is to shorten the names of the referenced missing instances i.e. XXX_html_repo_host or XXX-html5-srv. Try taking off 5-10 chars, doing a find and replace and ensuring all occurrences are updated.
If possible, please attach the mta.yaml for review.

    Answer is:  there,
I reviewed your issue above & I checked with my colleague & we believe your issue is not related to Fiori Tools.
The issue we believe is related to the virus scan configurations/profiles on the system. 
Either virus scan is not enable on the system or it is enabled and the virus scan server is down.

            Hi 
I am trying to use the custom task "deploy-to-abap" of the NPM module "@sap/ux-ui5-tooling" to deploy a UI5 application to an ABAP Environment on BTP. The problem is this application has multiple inbounds and that task only seems to allow one. I get an error similar to:WARN builder:custom deploy-to-abap Only one inbound is supported. Inbound INBOUND will be ignoredI want to include all inbounds. Is there a way to do this or is this a restriction of this module?
        
    Answer is: Hi , 
this is a restriction. It is documented at https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/eaaeba48e5e04949855f2763477cd557.html ("Only one intent is supported")

    Question Body: 
            What would the adaptation project's metadata and function implementation look like if we want to implement a UI5 Adaptation Project on the SAP standard application HCM FAB My Paystubs to implement the hook extHookAdjustViewModel? 
In the standard application this hook is called from the standard onInit implementation: 
/**    
 * @ControllerHook
 * Allows you to adjust the oViewModel after the controller was initialized
 * @callback hcm.fab.mypaystubs.controller.PaystubsList~extHookAdjustViewModel

if (this.extHookAdjustViewModel) {
    this.extHookAdjustViewModel(oViewModel);
}
        
    Answer is: The UI5 team has identified a bug in the original HCM application which causes the controller hook not to be identified. An incident will be created to get this resolved.

    Question Title: BAS - JavaScript syntax errors are no longer being highlighted
    Question Body: 
            I'm working on a SAP Fiori Application -> SAPUI5 freestyle -> SAPUI5 Application project and I noticed that the JavaScript syntax errors are no longer being highlighted. 
Note: I don't remember making any changes to the settings. 
Any idea where I can fix it? 
! 

        
    Answer is: Hi   ,
 for your feedback. I can answer from the Fiori generator perspective:
> I followed the link steps. The first one displayed the message "The 'package.json' doesn't contain 'sapux'. This is required for SAP Fiori elements applications project(package-json-sapux)" in yellow.
That yellow flag is fine, it's a warning that the Fiori project is not compatible with Fiori elements. In this case, that makes sense, as it's a Fiori freestyle (not Fiori elements) application that is being inspected.
> My mains question is: when finishing the creation of a project, SAP BAS displays a message informing that all dependencies were created. Wouldn't the eslint dependency be created automatically? I ask because a while ago syntax errors were highlighted without having to install anything.
The Fiori generator does not add code assist libraries by default, the user needs to choose this option in the advanced settings in the generator, or else after the fact using the documentation above. The reason why it's not included by default is that there are extra libraries that need to be downloaded and installed, which will increase the footprint and install time of the generated application.

    Question Title: npx fiori add deploy-config fails
    Question Body: 
             community, 
I'm currently migrating some on-premise freestyle apps which has been created usind WebIDE to VSCode.After cloning the package, I ran the "Fiori Migrate Project to use Fiori Tools" with success. 
I'm able to preview the app. Now I want to deploy the app to the system. 
npm install
npm run deploy 
the last command tells me that there is no deploy-config available and I should create one.  
I tried running 
npx fiori add deploy-config 
but this fails with following error 
PS C:\Users\myuser\VSCode_Workspace\zwmkommivorrat> npx fiori add deploy-config
Adding deploy-config to the project.
info Add:Deploy-config Using: C:\Users\myuser\test\node_modules\@sap\generator-fiori\generators\deploy-config\index.js
Error C:\Users\myuser\test\node_modules\@sap\generator-fiori\generators\deploy-config\index.js --base ui5.yaml --config ui5-deploy.yaml

You don't seem to have a generator with the name “C:\Users\myuser\test\node_modules\@sap\generator-fiori\generators\deploy-config\index.js” installed.
But help is on the way:

You can see available generators via npm search yeoman-generator or via http://yeoman.io/generators/.
Install them with npm install generator-C:\Users\myuser\test\node_modules\@sap\generator-fiori\generators\deploy-config\index.js.

To see all your installed generators run yo --generators. Adding the --help option will also show subgenerators.

If yo cannot find the generator, run yo doctor to troubleshoot your system.
Do you need to install @sap/generator-fiori globally?
npm install -g @sap/generator-fiori
OR
yarn global add @sap/generator-fioriWhat I'm really confused about is why the path of generator is 
C:\Users\myuser\test...This path doesn't exist anymore. It was a VSCode Workspace once but I've deleted it and the current project never was part of this Workspace. If I remove /test/ from path, I'm able to find the generator but for some reason, it always looks at this certain path.I looked on so many places to find this path, enivronment variables, config files etc. but wasn't able to find it.Does someone know, where this location is saved?
        
    Answer is: After uninstall VSCode, Extension, NodeJS together with all related folders inder C:\users\myuser\AppData... which seems to be part of VSCode or Fiori like
.fiori.vscode.code
and even others, I was able tu run it after re-insstallation of the entire environment.Simply uninstall and install without deleting artefacts didn't work.

    Question Title: Problems launching first Fiori App
    Question Body: 
            , 
We are currently developing our first Fiori application. For this we are using ABAP CDS in Eclipse with ADT and SAP Fiori Tools in VS Code. 
Since the company uses a proxy server, I have stored proxy entries for npm to be able to install and update packages. 
While the preview of the app in Eclipse works without problems, errors occur when calling "npm run start" or "npm start" in VS Code: 
1. the browser shows only a blank white page. 
2. the following message appears twice in the terminal: 
TypeError [ERR_INVALID_PROTOCOL]: Protocol "https:" not supported. Expected "http:"    at new NodeError (node:internal/errors:371:5)    at new ClientRequest (node:_http_client:158:11)    at Object.request (node:https:353:10)    at Array.stream (<PATH-OF-PROJECT>\node_modules\@sap\ux-ui5-tooling\dist\middlewares\fiori-tools-proxy.js:59033:74)    at ProxyServer.<anonymous> (<PATH-OF-PROJECT>\node_modules\@sap\ux-ui5-tooling\dist\middlewares\fiori-tools-proxy.js:58796:21)    at HttpProxyMiddleware.<anonymous> (<PATH-OF-PROJECT>\node_modules\@sap\ux-ui5-tooling\dist\middlewares\fiori-tools-proxy.js:57898:32)    at Generator.next (<anonymous>)    at fulfilled (<PATH-OF-PROJECT>\node_modules\@sap\ux-ui5-tooling\dist\middlewares\fiori-tools-proxy.js:57872:58) 
If I delete the proxy entries via "npm config rm proxy" and "npm config rm https-proxy" and then run "npm start" again, the following happens: 
1. The browser displays only the header with the SAP logo and the title of the application but no content. 
2. The following error is displayed several times in the terminal: 
Error: unable to verify the first certificate    at TLSSocket.onConnectSecure (node:_tls_wrap:1530:34)    at TLSSocket.emit (node:events:520:28)    at TLSSocket._finishInit (node:_tls_wrap:944:8)    at TLSWrap.ssl.onhandshakedone (node:_tls_wrap:725:12) 
When I run "npm run start-mock" the same thing happens.  
If I run "npm run start-local", then the app is displayed correctly in the browser. But the following error messages appear in the terminal:

    Question Title: VSCode UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE on-premise system with valid certificate
    Question Body: 
             community,  
this is less a question but might be helpful for others fighting with this issue.Related to this question here, I was still unable to connect to a on-premise S/4 (2020) system. 
The system I want to connect uses an official certificate of our company, it is not a self-signed certificate but a certificate verified by a trustful and trusted vendor. To add the system as SAP system in VSCode, I ran Fiori App Generator and tried to add it as new system like this: 
 
But it always gives me the error UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE. 
I disabled all SSL related settings in VSCOde, I've installed the certificate chain over and over again and tried different nodejs settings like disable SSL_strict and also set environment variable NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS like described here.  
Also I asked our SAP administrator to provide a HTTP connection and even this didn't work as it still keeps redirecting to HTTPS. 
Luckily, I'm able to connect to an SAP ECC System (on-premise) by HTTP. I don't understand what is different here as this also uses the same certificates but it seems not to redirect for some reason. I used it to build a connection because I was interested what gets saved in which file. 
After connection was set up to ECC system, I simply can change related settings (URL) like this. Please note, it still doesn't work with SSL but for some reason, HTTP works now. I also tried to build a new application with success. I got a huge list containing all active oData system of our S/4 on-premise system 
The connection gets saved in a file named systems.json which is located at C:\users\<username>\.fioritools and the content looks like this. 
{
  "systems": {
    "http://<url to your system>:8000/100": {
      "name": "myS4",
      "url": "http://<url to your system>:8000",
      "client": "100",
      "userDisplayName": "myUser"
    }
  }
} 
So if anyone ran into the same issue, simply try to create a connection like this manually.  
Hope this helps some people out there.

    Question Title: Fiori-tools-proxy directLoad applies only to root index.html file. Is the expected behavior?
    Question Body: 
            
 
 
   there,
  I'm not sure it is a bug or just missing bit on documentation: directLoad is not changing script sources to UI5 on HTML files except the index.html located on webapp root.
  I'm using @sap/ux-ui5-tooling @ 1.5.0 , and tested three different scenarios:
   
   webapp/test/mockData.html -> UI5 lib loading goes through ux-proxy 
   webapp/mockData.html -> UI5 lib loading goes through ux-proxy 
   webapp/index.html (just renaming mockData.html to index.html) -> Direct Load works 
  
  Relevant part of HTML file located on webapp/test folder (I also tested changing relative "./../" to absolute to root "/"): 
  <script src="./../test-resources/sap/ushell/bootstrap/sandbox.js" id="sap-ushell-bootstrap"></script>
<script id="sap-ui-bootstrap" 
  src="./../resources/sap-ui-core.js"
  ...
</script>
  Relevant part of YAML file (pretty much the same as described tooling readme): 
  server:
  customMiddleware:
  - name: fiori-tools-proxy
    afterMiddleware: compression
    configuration:
      ui5:
        path:
        - /resources
        - /test-resources
        url: https://ui5.sap.com
        version: 1.71.38
        directLoad: true
  ux-proxy logger confirming that library was being loaded through proxy, although directLoad was set.
  
  Kind 
 

        
    Answer is:   ,
sorry for the caused confusion. Indeed the documentation needs to be updated. The directLoad works only with the default HTML files, which are created during project generation. Hence index.html, flpSandbox.html and flpSandboxMockServer.html.
I will see that the documentation gets updated.

    Question Title: SAP Application Studio displays "missing id" error Messages in SAP UI5 XML Views
    Question Body: 
            Hi UI5 Community, 
I am using the standard SAP UI5 freestyle App template within SAP Application Studio. Since ux-ui-tooling version 1.4.6, I get a lot of error Messages in my XML Views (see screenshot). These error messages are all caused by missing "id" attribute within my Control and layout nodes. Oddly, even within List items that error messages appear and demands "id" values, which causes none unique id attributes anymore and that might harm html validation...  
Does anyone one know, how to influence the XML validation linting within SAP UI5 toolchain and the SAP Application Studio? I would like to have it less aggressive... 
My App works without any problem, when I ignore these error messages, but it will confuse my coworkers and client. 
Thank you very much in advance

    Question Title: Adding a custom section in Object Page with Flexible Column Layout does not work
    Question Body: 
            
 
 
  Hi,
  I was following https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-elements-opensap/blob/main/week2/unit6.md exercise of OpenSAP course to add a custom section in an object page of a Fiori Elements app in VS Code. After performing all steps correctly, the app doesn't show the newly added section. 
  Then later when I tried the same approach by creating a new app in BAS, it worked. Then on comparing the differences between both apps, I figured out that the only difference is that my VS Code app has flexible column layout while a new app on BAS has standard layout. So I tested this by switching to standard layout on VS Code and it worked.
  I don't if the issue is with UI5 version (1.97) or SAP Fiori Tools so could you please help me to raise this to correct team?
  BR, 
 

        
    Answer is: Hi   ,  
This is caused because of view caching.The issue can be solved by adding sap-ui-xx-viewCache=false as a URL parameter before # symbol.

    Question Body: 
            
 
 
  I note that the documentation for the SAP Fiori Tools - Guided Development states:
  The generated application requires the following software to be installed:
  
   NodeJS Version 10.16 or higher
   Windows OS requires windows-build-tools NPM module installed globally.
  
  And I also note that the windows-build-tools is also a deprecated. See below.
  
  Is a global installation of windows-build-tools still required on Windows OS? 
 

        
    Answer is: Hi w,
Thank you for bringing this to our attention. The notification is indeed correct, windows-build-tools is no longer required. After a quick search, I see that this was stated on Visual Studio Code Marketplace -- we will remove it from the prerequisites. Is this where you found it? If not, would you please share the link so that we can ensure that it gets updated as well?

    Question Title: Deployment with translation key from BAS
    Question Body: 
            Hi experts, 
recently we were trying to deploy an application from Business Application Studio to our OnPremise System. The application included a translation key for making translations of i18n propertie files with transaction SE63. When using WebIDE it was normal that the key was registered within some certain database tables. It seams that this doesn't happen any longer when deploying from BAS. Do you know why? Or is it maybe just a bug in the deployment of the UI5 tooling??? Looking forward to your answers. 
Greetings
        
    Answer is: Hi everybody, 
after some research and due to the fact that we had also another problem with the deployment of applications from BAS to OnPremise Systems, we found a SAP Note with some dependencies to other SAP Notes. All Notes do focus on the deployment itself. When we uploaded the corresponding Notes the deployment worked without problems (it was even faster than before) and also the registration of the translation key was done automatically like expected. 
The corresponding note was: https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3089702

    Question Title: Loading the OData in the UI5 works , but the hostname is different , then how is it working ???
    Question Body: 
            I am trying to call an Odata service , when I press a button on my basic UI5 app (**First time UI5 developer). 
I added the service as a destination while setting up the project using a template . 
The destination got added to the xs-app.json.file as shown in screenshot 1. 
My OData is working perfectly when i test it from POSTMAN . 
Now I am trying to load the OData model in my UI app . 
I noticed that my ui5-local.yaml shows the host name properly Screenshot 2 . 
The hostname is also right 
But I tried to call the OData on the click of a button .I have written the code and looked at the chrome debugger .But the URL is being called with a different hostname . Screenshot 3 
But the point is it also shows the status code is 200 . 
I am not sure , if I am doing it properly . 
SCREENSHOT 1:- (xs-app.json file) 
SCREENSHOT 2 : UI5-local.yaml fie 
SCREENSOT 3:- 
The basic code that I have written 

        
    Answer is: It's because CORS(Cross Origin Resource Sharing) policy.
Your UI5 app source code comes from a BTP server(BAS), but your data comes from a different server.
If your app on a browser tries to connect to a different server, a browser will block this request so you can't read data.
To avoid this problem, your app calls BTP server(BAS) where the UI5 source code came from to access data and BTP server calls your real odata server.
When you run your app in BAS, a small nodejs server starts on your dev space.
The Url in screenshot 3 is the url of the nodejs server.
App(your browser) ----> NodeJS server(in BAS) --------> oData source

  This results in the following warning:
  
  What are the pre-requisites to get the page map displayed? Please send a PR to correct this in the sample repository or help here so that I can create such a pull request.
  Best 
 

        
    Answer is: Hi ,
The steps are in the screen shot as shown above ('packagejason.png'). Essentially, you need to list out the app in the samples/fiori/package.json so SAP Fiori tools can recognize these apps as SAP Fiori tools relevant.
Example:
"sapux": [ 
 "app/browse",
"app/admin"
 ] 
After doing this, if you right click on the "samples" folder to start Page Map, you should get the project picker prompting you to choose between these two apps.

    Question Title: SAPUI5 Fiori Elements - Flexible Column Layout documentation error
    Question Body: 
            It seems that two things should be corrected on this page (SAPUI5 documentation for Enabling the Flexible Column Layout). I followed the instructions for OData V4 to manually change my manifest.json, but it didn't work. Then I successfully enabled the Flexible Column Layout using SAP Fiori Tools. When I compared my changes to those done by Fiori Tools I noticed that two things are incorrect in the documentation: 
 
 The changes must be made under "sap.ui5" and not under "sap.ui". 
 A new dependency called "sap.f" must be added under "sap.ui5" -> "dependencies" -> "libs". Without this, I get the error "App could not be opened because the SAP UI5 component of the application could not be loaded." 

        
    Answer is: Hi ,
FYI - I've checked the Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V4 - Enabling the Flexible Column Layout (version 1.93.0) documentation and the missing requirement is mentioned there (not in the code snippet, but at least in the text).

    Question Title: Can ABAP memory be used in Fiori
    Question Body: 
            Hi guys, 
I want to export salesoder data to abap memory in "userexit_save_document", and import data from abap memory in "userexit_refresh_document". The data should only be used in internal session. So I can't use SAP memory. 
BUT I don't make sure is ABAP Memory worked in Fiori…… 
Is there any other method to pass data in an internal session? 
Thank you and best  
Vinnie
        
    Answer is: I'm also not sure what is meant by "in Fiori". But one way of sharing data between two exits within the same internal session is as follows.Create a class to hold the logic of the exits. Make it a singleton, so that it can only return the same instance via a static method e.g. GET_INSTANCE or FACTORY. In each exit you do this.FORM userexit_save_document.  DATA(exit_handler) = zcl_sales_order_handler=>get_instance( )->exit_handler( ).  exit_handler->set_parameters( ... ).  exit_handler->do_save_document_exit( ).  some_form_parameter = exit_handler->get_form_parameter( ).ENDFORM.Do something similar for userexit_refresh_document. In addition to being able to share state between the exits, you get all the benefits of OO programming by shifting the logic into its own class. This also means that once set up, multiple developers can work on different exits without getting in each others way.

    Question Title: Partially solved: VS Code App generator fails on premise
    Question Body:

So it seems to be caused by some way connecting to local ECC system. Are there any ICF services necessary (between the oData services itself obviously)? 

        
    Answer is: ,
after spending hours into this issue it finally works with some limitations. Our System landscape consists of a SAP ECC System (Backend) and a standalone Fiori Gateway system (frontend).
I'm not able to connect to frontend system (Option "Connect to a system"). For some reason, it always return "URI invalid", which is not true
I'm not able to connect to frontend system (Option "Connect to oData Service"). This gets caused as the system is configured to use SAML Authentication, which fails here. It is possible to also use basic authentication, but Yeoman generator doesn't provide this option.
But I'm able to connect to backend system (Option "Connect to oData Service"). After authentication, it provides a list of all known services (/ifwnd/maint_service). Read carefully, it provides a list of all KNOWN services, which means, it also shows services which are known but corresponding ICF node is inactive. You can't distinct if the service is really active or configured but inactive. If you choose a service which is inactive, the error I've posted as initial question occurs. Because we use this service in production (registered and active on frontend system) I didn't check if it also runs on backend system.
This just as reference, if someone else run into this issue.

    Question Title: Using odata service in freestyle app in Business Application Studio
    Question Body: 
            
 
 
  Previously I created a free style app project in BAS using the "SAP Fiori Freestyle Project" template however it is now flagged as deprecated.
  I am therefore using the "SAP Fiori application" template and using the "application type" freestyle.
  The issue is that I used to be able to use the Northwind service as a data source which I have configured as a destination as follows:
  
  With the old template I could pull in this destination in the project creation wizard as follows:
  
  Using the new template it always gives an error when trying to retrieve the service:
  
  Of course Northwind is not a SAP system but "Connect to an SAP System" is the only Data source that allows me to see "Northwind" as an option under "System".
  Does anyone know how I can use this Northwind destination in the new template creation option?
 

        
    Answer is: A very good question. In fact, I actually had the same question when I first saw this new generator. The product team told me that they don't consider Northwind an SAP System, which I can understand as it's technically correct. But I also understand this is a change as we previously considered it to be one.That doesn't mean that you can't continue to use this destination for simple web apps. You can continue to do so by selecting "Connect to an OData Service" and provide the URL of the service in the wizard. Then, the traffic redirect will be baked in your run configuration and later in the project, when you add the deployment configuration, you'll get prompted for a destination name. There, you can enter "Northwind" and everthing will work when you deploy your web app.

    Answer is: Hi ,
FT 1.4 should have this functionality, yes. Please ensure you have added deployment configuration to your project, you will not be able to see the deploy-test target until you do. You can add deployment configuration to your existing project by executing (from your project root):
npm run deploy-config
Also, the deploy-test target is currently only supported for ABAP deployments and not  Foundry.

    Question Title: Is xs-app routing needed for UI5 application cache buster? (CF Application Runtime / HTML5 Repo)
    Question Body: 
            Once application cache busting is enabled and the sap-ui-cachebuster-info.json is available, UI5 will start looking in the timestamped directory for the resource. 
E.g. /webapp/~1623054905000~/controller/App.controller.js 
Is it up to us to provide a routing to these original files in both deployment to a standalone app in the  Foundry Application Runtime and the HTML5 Application Repository? 
At the moment I am achieving this via specific routing in the Approuter, but it's because I don't find any specific documentation, that I'm not sure this is the intended way.  
    {
      "source": "^/webapp(?:/~\\d+~)?/(.*)$",
      "authenticationType": "xsuaa",

    Answer is: I've tested both scenario's:

- UI5 app served by its own @sap/approuter: doesn't work out of the box, requires routing as shown above

    Question Title: SAP Fiori Tools - ui5 serve / Appreload very slow
    Question Body: 
            Hi, 
we use in our projects ui5-tooling and setup in the ui5.yaml the following: 
    - name: fiori-tools-appreload
      afterMiddleware: compression
      configuration:
        port: 35729
        path: webapp 
If i execute the command "ui5 serve" and open the app in edge chromium then all libraries (like sap.m or sap.f) are loaded as single files (more then 1800 requests). Because of that it takes over 8 seconds to load the app and on each reload i have to wait 8 seconds again. 
If i try the same in the old WebIDE then the loading of the app needs 1,5 seconds (112 requests) beacuse the library-preload.js are loaded. 
How is it possible to load the library-preload.js for sap.* components with ui5-tooling? URL-Parameter like "sap-ui-xx-componentPreload=async" don't work. 
 and  
 
Versions: 
ui5-tooling: 2.2.4 
@sap/ux-ui5-tooling: 1.0.18
        
    Answer is: , this was asked some months ago, since then I could convert some projects to local development and what I did was simply add proxy rule to route UI5 library calls to CDN, as written on NPM Readme.

Yesterday also, I was able to deploy. Today I released a TR and created new TR and getting this issue. Could you please someone help? 

        
    Answer is: Hi  Saha,
Could you update the ux-ui5-tooling version? You can follow the steps below:1. cd <your-project-folder> 2. Delete package-lock.json file 3. Run: npm install @sap/ux-ui5-tooling@latest 4. Open pakcage.json file to verify that you have “@sap/ux-ui5-tooling”: “^1.3.2" in devDependencies section. 5. In the latest version, we also use a different deploy script. So you need to find this line in “scripts” section of package.json:  “deploy”: “ui5 build preload --clean-dest --config ui5-deploy.yaml --include-task=generateManifestBundle generateCachebusterInfo && rimraf archive.zip”,  Replace it with:  “deploy”: “npm run build && fiori deploy --config ui5-deploy.yaml”,

    Question Title: How to swap @Analytics Annotations?
    Question Body: 
            I currently work on a PoC using CAP and SmartCharts.In order to make the SmartCharts work, I need to annotate some properties of an entity with @Analytics.AnalyticalContext.Dimension : true.Annotating the properties within the entity definition works well, but to seperate concerns I would like to know, how to annotate those properties from another file. Here my attempts : 
1.annotate Entity.Property with @Analytics.AnalyticalContext.Dimension: true;
2.
annotate Entity with Analytics.AnalyticalContext : [
            {
                Dimension: true,
                Property : 'Property'
            }
        ]
);
3.annotate Service.Entity.Property with @Analytics.AnalyticalContext.Dimension: true;
4.
annotate Service.Entity with Analytics.AnalyticalContext : [
            {
                Dimension: true,
                Property : 'Property'
            }
        ]
);
        
    Answer is: Please check db/data-model.cds#L21. There I'm adding the @Analytics.Dimension : true annotation to a field from a OData API that I use to create my local persistence.

    Question Title: Export to Excel not working in Fiori Elements List Report
    Question Body: 
            I am using SAPUI5 Version 1.78.9 and created a custom Fiori Elements List Report using VS Code Fiori Tools Extension.Despite passing true to Export to Excel parameter, the Export Button is not coming up in the App. Is there any limitation to this functionality being available for certain UI5 Versions?
        
    Answer is: Hi,I had the similar problems. In my App I am using multiple variants (=Tabs). I have to use 1.71 - but with 1.84 it would work correctly.I could solve the problem by extending the app. In onInit you can set the excel export visibility by method setUseExportToExcel( true) of the smarttable.lg

    Question Title: Error when preparing custom task UI for deployment
    Question Body: 
            Hi community, 
I'm facing an issue when trying to deploy a Custom Task UI as per the SAP help documentation:  
Creating a Custom Task UI 
On step 10 it is required to run the following command: 
npm run deploy-config cf 
 When I run the command I'm getting an error after selecting the Destination Name as "None": 
TypeError: Cannot read property 'deploy_mode' of null 
 
I've documented all the steps here. 
Anyone have any ideas? 
, 

        
    Answer is: Turns out the only thing missing was the "deploy_mode: html5-repo" parameter at the root level of the mta.yaml. I would have expected it to be added during step 3 while generating the Approuter configuration. 

After adding the parameter, I managed to rerun the deploy-config script successfully.
npm run deploy-config cf

After reading the blog "Simplifying application generation for SAPUI5 freestyle and SAP Fiori elements apps", I followed the tutorial Deploy Your First SAPUI5 App, and I even created all artifacts with the exact same names provided there, but can't get it to work.

I tried to carry on with the tutorial though. Despite npm install failing, the mtar file is generated on build, the deploy also finishes succesfully, but, the app is not visible in the Launchpad content provider, so it cannot be added as a tile. 
One thing I noticed is that the "crossNavigation" key in manifest.json (as explained here) is not generated automatically by the plugin, nor the tutorial instructs to add it. I tried the tutorial exactly as described (without the key) and then tried it adding the "crossNavigatino" key, but in both cases, the app is not seen by the launchpad content provider. 
I even created a new BAS DevSpace in case anything had changed and mine was outdated, but no luck, still same errors and behavior appear. 
Anyone has any ideas?
        
    Answer is: ,
Many  for the question and for reaching out. You are correct regarding the warning message during 
npm install
This is an optional library that is only required on some landscapes and not others. You can safely ignore this as the install still completes. Having said that, it is confusing to our customers and we are investigating how to remove this error.
In terms of the "crossNavigation", this is added to your manifest.json file when you choose to add FLP configuration, either during generation or afterward. During generation, there is a Yes/No question on the Project Attributes step: "Add FLP Configuration". If you choose "Yes" here, an extra step will be added to the generator for you to fill out.
Alternatively, you can always add FLP configuration after generation by browsing to the project folder on the command line and typing:
npx fiori add flp-config
I hope that helps.

    Question Title: What is the use for manifest-bundle.zip?
    Question Body: 
            UI5 Tooling provides a build task 'generateManifestBundle'. 
This generates a manifest-bundle.zip which is placed in the dist folder. 
What is the use for manifest-bundle.zip?
        
    Answer is: It's a requirement for some services that access the HTML5 app repo. I.e. the Launchpad and Portal services need it to be able to parse certain metadata about the web app.

    Question Title: CAP Fiori Elements Dropdown
    Question Body: 
            Hey guys, 
i am trying to create a dropdown list but i have a problem with the display. 
I have two entities(fragebogen and eigenfremdanamnese) and one (JaNein) which serves as a CodeList. 
 
my common.cds 
 
I only want the text and not the code: 
 
For the list i have a csv: 
 
When i run the app i don't get a dropdown but rather this popup 
 
 
and after choosing one of them, not the name is displayed but the code: 
 
How can i change it into a dropdown and why isn't the name shown but instead the code? 
Can you guys help me out? 
 
  

        
    Answer is:   ,
are you sure you use the correct entity in your common.cds? Do you use the code completion (CTRL/CMD++Space) to see the available elements in the annotate directive?

To me it looks like the eigendfremdAntwort1 and eigendfremdAntwort2 are elements of eigenfremdanamnese and not Fragebogen.

You can check if this is the root cause of your problem.

    Question Title: Problems with Fiori Generator
    Question Body: 
            Tutorials: https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/fiori-tools-cap-create-application.html --------------------------  Hey there, i tried to make a Fiori Elements List Report Object Page. In the tutorial it looks like this. But in my Generator the "Navigation entity" doesnt exist. Some hints? Maybe i did something wrong with my cap.service or the db.cds? 
What are the reqirements for the "Navigation entity"? 
 in advantage 

        
    Answer is:  Jose Luis ,
The availability of the navigation entity depends on your service and the option you selected as a main entity. Did you use the Incidents service and chose Incidents as a main entity? If so you should see the Navigation entity field with 2 options: incidentFlow and incidentProcessTimeline. These correspond to the Incidents entity elements defined as Association to many in schema.cds, see https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-elements-incident-management/blob/main/db/schema.cds#L47.
If you by mistake select e.g. IncidentFlow as a main entity, you won't be able to choose the Navigation entity, as this entity does not contain any elements defined as association to many, see https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-elements-incident-management/blob/main/db/schema.cds#L62

    Question Title: how to test ui5 applications locally in vscode
    Question Body: 
             s, 
I have created simple list report application using ui5 tooling( Managed approuter) which consumes ES5 destination created in cloud foundry. I am getting a popup requesting to enter username and password to connect to ES5 system. Please let me know if there is any procedure to test destinations locally. 
Github project : https://github.com/imran-syed-abdul/local-destination.git
        
    Answer is: Hi Syed,It sounds to me like you're looking for this awesome ui5 tooling middleware :) ui5-middleware-simpleproxy (the credits go to Volker Buzek ). I think there is another tool that you can use to hook the proxy directly to CF destinations via a tunnel (or something like that). But I can't remember the name of that toll. Maybe someone else can help me out here.

    Answer is: , I had the same issue and performed the steps provided in the comment of Vivay:
Please follow below steps as specified by   -
 
 Uninstall the existing generator with the command: npm uninstall -g @sap/generator-fiori.
 Then try and install the generator again by executing: npm i -g @sap/generator-fiori

I have previously downloaded nodejs in my pc and installed it in order to have npm available.

    Question Title: Fiori Tooling Visual studio code
    Question Body: 
            Hi s, 
I have installed SAP Fiori Tools - Extension Pack in Visual studio code to create a Fiori App. I am surprised to see that when generated application for Worklist layout, it didn't generate Controller and View Folder. No view and controller file generated. Also when run the app it doesn't show any data whereas oData service returns the data successfully. Also can't see any command in sap fiori guide to create new view. Can someone help who has used this tool before.  
Below is the structure of my app - 
        
    Answer is: Hi ,
the SAP Fiori tools Worklist template is based on Fiori elements. Hence there is no controller or view code needed, everything comes out of the box to render an application. However in order to see data in your table you need to define line item annotations for your service. In absence of those please click on the personalization dialog (the wheel on the right) to add some columns manually during preview.
Please have a look into the Fiori elements (https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/03265b0408e2432c9571d6b3feb6b1fd) and Fiori tools documention (https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_FIORI_tools/Latest/en-US) to get familiar with the Fiori elements programming model - it's worth trying.
In case you want to create a Fiori freestyle app, you can choose the freestyle templates in the drop down above the tiles in the generator.

    Question Title: Nothing happens when launching Application Generator in local Vscode installation.
    Question Body: 
             s, 
I have installed latest Vscode on my laptop.Also installed Fiori extension pack. 
When I launch Application Generator through command pallet nothing happens. 
Does any component or step missing ? 
I have only installed vscode and Fiori extension pack.Does node.js is necessary ? 
Please help.
        
    Answer is:  Guru,
Sorry to hear you are having issues :(. Can you please ensure that the "Application Wizard" VSCode extension is installed? It should be included as part of the Fiori extension pack. Once it is, can you please launch it from the command palette: "Open Template Wizard". Once this launches, it should show you the generators that are installed.
If the Fiori generator is not installed, please click on "Explore and Install Generators" in top right hand corner. Then search for "Fiori" and install the "@sap/generator-fiori" that appears. It should already have been installed, but it looks like it hasn't for you.

    Question Title: FIORI Launchpad Splitscreen Issue after navigation to other app
    Question Body: 
            Dear s, 
we are getting this split screen bug when sometimes navigating back from one app to the other (first back button in browser and then click on the other app tile). We are using FIORI elements and deployed our app to SAP  Portal FIORI Launchpad (SDK is BAS). Do you have any idea for the root cause? Everything else works as expected... 
 
 
 
BR
        
    Answer is: Dear all,
fyi - fortunately, I was able to fix this issue. The reason was the onExit()-Event which destroyed the whole embedded view when navigating back from the application - either via browser or via internal arrow back. Since it is being handled automatically by the framework, there is no need to implement an onExit() handler in our case.
 onExit: function () { 
 this.oDataModel.refresh() 
 this.getView().destroy(); 
 this._wizard.destroy(); 
}

             All, 
While trying to create a Fiori UI on a CAP based project, we are unable to select Destination as no option is coming (generally it comes as None); and hence cannot move to next step. We are trying in a Production Environment. 
Any clue is appreciated. 
bas-issue.jpg 
 
.
        
    Answer is:  ,
We have identified this as a bug in our code :(, and one that will be fixed in our next release. As a work around, could you please do the following:
1. Generate your application without any deployment configuration (select 'no' to the question in the Project Attributes step).
2. After generation, open a terminal in BAS and navigate to the Fiori project folder that was newly created in your CAP project. Then type `npm run deploy-config`, this will allow you to add the  Foundry destinations as needed.
Please let me know if this works for you?

    Question Title: Object Page error after generation
    Question Body: 
            Hi guys, 
I've created a small cap service and created with the fiori tools a list report page. The list page is working fine. However, when I navigate to the object page (displayed in the master detail layout) I receive an error 'A technical error has occurred, Cannot read property 'Value' of undefined' 
 
Is there a way of debugging the fiori elements app, so I could solve the problem? 
Here is the project: https://github.com/SAP/nutritionTracker/tree/feature/FioriUI 
Thank you, 

        
    Answer is: Hi , 
I've created a fork with some changes to make the project compatible with Fiori tools. See 
https://github.com/SAP/nutritionTracker/compare/feature/FioriUI...devinea:feature/FioriUI 
Object page loads now. 
 
Also, I moved uimodule to app/uimodule as app is the default folder for webapps in CAP. 
You appear to have created your project using the Fiori Generator using the odata url. 
Fiori generator supports using the CAP project as a datasource (instead of the odata URL)  
https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/99061814ead548808d539861fb27bafb.html 
 
This has the advantage of using CAP CDS based annotations instead of XML/EMDX annontations and better integration with Fiori tools.

    Answer is: Hi ,
Yes, it looks like proxy configuration will be required. Can you please try the following from the command line:
npm config get proxyandnpm config get https-proxyIf they are not returning the details of your Corporate proxy, then you will need to set them as follows (replacing the parameters below with your proxy details):
npm config set proxy http://<username><password>@proxy-server-url>:<port>andnpm config set https-proxy http://<username><password>@proxy-server-url>:<port>And then restart VSCode.
Please see https://medium.com/@ogbemudiatimothy/using-npm-install-behind-a-corporate-proxy-server-db150c128899 for an example on how to do this.

    Question Title: XML Annotation Language Server waiting for connection
    Question Body: 
            Hi guys, 
I'm testing the fiori tools in vs code. When I'm trying to start the add-ons service modeler, the xml toolkit or the xml annotation language service for all add-ons I receive an unexpect error (bottom right at the picture). In the status bar I then could see that the message 'XML Annotation Language Server waiting for connection'. 
Does all three add-ons rely on the xml annotation language server?Is there a way to start the server manually to maybe get a more detailed error description? 
Cheers, 

        
    Answer is:  ,
no, these extensions do not rely on the installed XML Annotation Language Server. The message in the task bar just means that the client part of XML annotation LSP is connecting to its server part. When it is connected, this message disappears and is substituted with the success message XML Annotation Language Server: ready (visible for 10 seconds). If the message 'XML Annotation Language Server waiting for connection' stays forever, there is either a problem with your project or a bug. In this case I would encourage you to create an issue for the component CA-UX-IDE and attach your (zipped) project to it. We would then investigate the problem and provide the solution.
You may also want to check your manifest.json for the data source definitions and check the path to annotation and metadata files there.

What could be missing? 

        
    Answer is: Hi Ivan,
The Fiori tools call the UI5 ABAP Repository OData service (https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/a883327a82ef4cc792f3c1e7b7a48de8) to deploy an application to an ABAP system.
Based on your (correct) configuration, the tools will try to deploy to your central hub. However, based on the log, I am assuming that your hub is forwarding the request to the backend together with all other requests to OData services.
Would you be able to change the configuration so that requests to the UI5 ABAP Repo service are handled on the hub instead of being forwarded like the rest? Otherwise, you could also manually deploy the application using the report /UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD (https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/a560bd6ed4654fd1b338df065d331872) 
Cheers,

    Question Title: BAS - Access to Fiori Application Modeler not possible
    Question Body: 
            Hey together, 
I am very new to the Business Application Studio... I created a project with the wizard...After I opened the project in the workspace I wanted to use some of the Fiori Tools, like the Application Modeler or "Show Page Map"... 
But unfortunetly I am getting an Error "Could not find any SAP Fiori projects in workspace" or "Unable to find relevant SAP Fiori tools project" do I need to do some several settings? 
  

        
    Answer is: Hi   , As mentioned by   , Page map and Application Modeler tools are currently only supported for Fiori elements based applications.You can find more information on Fiori tools in our documentation https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/f09752ebcf63473e9194ea29ca232e56.html You can see in the section Build SAP Fiori Applications with SAP Fiori tools, that some extensions are marked as Fiori elements only.

    Question Title: Fiori: Open Application Generator
    Question Body: 
            When running Fiori: Open Application Generator in VSCode terminal, I get error. I have node.js v12.18.2. 
{"message":"@sap/fiori:app generator failed - runGenerator() Cannot read property 'resolved' of undefined","stack":"TypeError: runGenerator() Cannot read property 'resolved' of undefined\n\tat v.<anonymous> (c:\\Users\\ssaha\\.vscode\\extensions\\sapos.yeoman-ui-1.1.59\\dist\\extension.js:193:114559)\n\tat Generator.next (<anonymous>)\n\tat s (c:\\Users\\ssaha\\.vscode\\extensions\\sapos.yeoman-ui-1.1.59\\dist\\extension.js:193:110253)"}
        
    Answer is: We are working to improve the robustness of this command. As a workaround, can you try the following?
1. Create a folder under your home directory (i.e. /home/user/generators)
2. Open Visual Studio Code->Preferences and enter the full path to the folder in the Application Wizard: Installation Location setting



3. Using the command palette, open the command "Template Wizard".
4. Click on the "Explore and Install Generators", and search for "fiori".
5. Install the "@sap/generator-fiori" generator.
6. After this, you should be able to use command "Fiori: Open Application Generator" without any error.

    Question Title: Fiori Tools (VSCode) socket hang up during FE App creation with on prem  OData Connection
    Question Body: 
            Hi, 
I have a problem with Fiori Tools in VSCode. 
When I create a Fiori Elements App (LROP) with the Template Wizard (Fiori Tools version 1.1.4) and try to connect to one of our on premise  Systems (1909 FP00), I get the error message: A connection error occurred, please ensure the target host is available on the network: socket hang up 
I can connect the same system (manually) to a free style application as datasource without any problems!? 
It's a bit annoying, because it used work flawlessly with an older version of the FE Template :-( 
Unfortunately, I cannot see a more detailed error message - output / VSCode Dev Tools :-(  
Does anybody has the same problem? 
Any kind of help is more than appreciated :-) 
 
 
 
 

        
    Answer is: Good news - problem is solved! :-)
First of all - many  and kudos to Ian  and  O'Connor for debugging so patiently with me!
In the end it was an issue with the axios call (get) to our OData Catalog service.
btw: the output pane in VSCode reveals more details if you set environment variable AXIOS_LOG to true (AXIOS_LOG=true).
I investigated on axios socket hang up errors and found this interesting blog on stackoverflow:
javascript - Socket hang up when using axios.get, but not when using https.get - Stack Overflow
It suggests to delete all proxy related environment variables, in order to avoid socket hang up errors with axios.
After doing so (I had one http_proxy environment variable) and cleaning up .fioritools/systems.json, it worked flawlessly! :-)
Btw: we also got an SPNego message, but this was coming from our internal Kerberos SSO mechanism, however, obviously, it wasn't a showstopper!

    Question Title: BAS new Fiori Application Template - Approuter Configuration
    Question Body: 
            , 
I was using the newer Fiori Application Template (freestyle project) for the first time in Business Application Studio since the previous Fiori generator template is marked as deprecated now. 
There are some nice new features, like being able to autogenerate the cross navigation properties, etc... 
One thing I noticed is that the previous template options of choosing standalone approuter vs managed approuter are no longer in this template and the xs-security.json file and mta.yaml entries aren't added. 
I was able to add this setup by using the MTA module from template, but that failed to deploy to CF because it missed some properties in the MTA.yaml for the destination service.  
It was not terribly difficult to fix those issues and deploy, but just curious on why the template removed those options on the initial project creation and if there is any plan to add that to the new template?

    Answer is: Hi,  
Sorry to hear that you are experiencing these issues, however, we are actively working on them. Even in our latest release (Friday March 5th) there are improvements in how we manage and configure managed approuter flows. I've documented a number steps to allow you develop a Fiori Elements application, build and deploy it to CF and supporting FLP if that is your requirement.  
Please ignore the FLP steps if this is not your requirement.  
Also, a number of these manual steps are being automated as part of an upcoming release. 
Prerequisites  
1. As SAP customer, you have purchased the Launchpad service to support FLP (not required otherwise)  
2. Ensure you have the latest @sap/generator-fiori npm module installed or create a new SAP Fiori Dev Space  
3. Or In your existing dev space, update to the latest by running `npm i -g @sap/generator-fiori`, https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/generator-fiori for more info  
4. Understanding Managed Approuter https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-sapui5-create.html#5a114a0f-2e97-40cb-ba1c-8710e713a011  
5. Developing HTML5 Applications and Extensions https://help.sap.com/viewer/8c8e1958338140699bd4811b37b82ece//en-US/c1b9d6facfc942e3bca664ae06387e9b.html  
6. You have a UI5 destination configured for your sub account https://help.sap.com/viewer/6d3eac5a9e3144a7b43932a1078c7628//en-US/0a2e5a45d5494ec08318ead2019d54db.html  
7. Integrate your SAPUI5 app into your launchpad site https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-launchpad-integrate-sapui5-app.html 
Type: HTP 
URL: https://ui5.sap.com 
Proxy Type: Internet 
Authentication: NoAuthentication 
Add a new property HTML5.ForwardAuthToken , value: false 
Use default JDK truststore is enabled  
7. Alternatively, you can update the resource `<mta-id>-destination-service` to include the destination as per attached screen shot; 
Configuration 
 Step1. Open the command palette `View` -> `Find Command`  
a. Enter `Wizard` and select `Open Template Wizard` 
 b Select `Basic Multitarget Application` and press `Next`  
c. Enter a unique project name, unique within your organisation i.e. the name is used as MTA ID in the `mta.yaml` file  
**Note**: SAP Application Studio will restart itself with the new project as root folder  
Step2. Right click the newly generated `mta.yaml` and select `Create MTA Module from Template` a. Select `Approuter Configuration` and press `Start`  
b. Select your HTML5 application runtime `Managed Approuter`  
c. Enter a unique name for the business solution of the project | Enter a unique ID e.g. `<your-mta-id>-service` from step 1.c  
d. Do you plan to add a UI? `Yes`  
Step3. Open the command palette `View` -> `Find Command` -> `Fiori: Open Application Generator`  
a. Create a `SAP Fiori application`  
b. Module name: uniquemodulename (make sure its unique in your organisation)  
c. Namespace: com.hostname  
d. Select `Yes` to `Add deployment configuration`, ensuring the newly generated MTA file is selected, refer to next step `Target Name`  
e. Select `Yes` to `Add FLP configuration`, refer to next step `Overwrite` for input params, this is required for Launchpad to show your application tile  
Step4. Target Name  
a. Please choose the target - should default to  Foundry  
b. Destination name: Keep selected destination, otherwise input a valid destination appropriate for your environment  
Step5. Overwrite  
a. Semantic Object - somename<sth_unique> (should be a unique name for within your site)  
b. Action - display  
c. Title - My App Desc  
d. Subtitle - Fiori Rocks!  
Step6. Validate everything is working by right clicking on your new application and selecting `Preview Application`  
a. Ensure you are able to load and retrieve data  
Step7. Within your new Fiori application, open `webapp`-> `manifest.json` and at the end, append the following where the service is the id generated in step 2 "sap.cloud" { "public": true, "service": "<your-mta-id>-service" }  
**Note**: Adding `sap.cloud` to the manifest will be automatically added in a future release  
Step8. Change into the root folder containing `mta.yaml`, run `npm run build` which will build the MTA archives  
Step9. In the same folder, run `npm run deploy` and your app should be deployed  
Step10. Before configuring a tile in cFLP, validate that the app has been successfully deployed. You can see all applications in the `HTML5 Applications` section in your sub account -> HTML5 Applications list  
Step11. Alternatively, from the command line, you can run `cf html5-list -d` to see a list of all your HTML5 deployed applications with `sap.cloud.service` exposed, for more information https://help.sap.com/viewer/584e0bcbfd4a4aff91c815cefa0bce2d//en-US/83b0fb23e37d456caad1ad0448e14727.html

    Question Title: The Sap App Bas Studio or Visual Studio is NOT GOOD
    Question Body: 
            Why the node modules repeat in each app that we created?? Its more 17000 archives X 5 app then equal 85000 archives in my pc. Why not only one node_modules to all the workspace of apps??? I dont believe!!! 

        
    Answer is: Well, it is a good thought to save the space. But basically it's because each app is stand-alone in that perspective.Not all apps require the same node modules and not all apps require the same versions of the node modules. In fact there are cases where you specifically need different versions for different apps.Also, in this way, we can be sure that each app is developed consistently if there is only one app or 10 apps in total, with each of them separated.

    Question Title: sap.fe v4 custom object page sections and caching issues
    Question Body: 
            Hi, 
while working with custom ObjectPage sections using extension, i ran into caching issues to be able to see my changes inside the browser. 
After some investigations (and a nice hint on twitter) i figured out, that the underlying sapui5 cache is the reason for this, because the custom extensions are cached in the browser indexedDB storage. 
To get rid of this, i am using the following line inside my Component.js 
// disable ui5 cache for reuse components while developing
sap.ui.getCore().getConfiguration().setUI5CacheOn(false); 
Is there a better way of controlling this feature while developing? 
If not, i will wrap this at least in an if like (location.host === 'localhost') to avoid prod issue without cache. 
Best  

        
    Answer is: Hi ,exactly the outcome of the Fiori elements templates (including the custom sections) are cached for better performance. 
During development you can just add the following URL parameter: sap-ui-xx-viewCache=false 
(see also https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/topic/91f2d03b6f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070.html)

    Question Title: sap.fe v4 Multiple Views on List Report Tables
    Question Body: 
            Hi, 
trying to use multiple view on list report, i ran into a SAP Fiori Tools bug and created an issue for it: 
31626 / 2021 SAP Fiori Tools removes used code from manifest 
Also, the SAPUI5 SDK links for this currently lacks of content (or issue?): 
https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/0d390fed360c4c58a0f0619338938de1 
https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/37aeed74e17a42caa2cba3123f0c15fc 
but i got it running,using using a manifest.json like this 
"views": {
  "showCounts": true,
  "paths": [{
    "key": "tab1",
    "annotationPath": "com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.SelectionVariant#Offer"
  }, {
    "key": "tab2",
    "annotationPath": "com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.SelectionVariant#All"
  }]
}... 
Generelly i would like to do this without tabs using the SegmentButton, but currently the docu lacks how to do this. 
My question and problem is, that the used filters in the SelectionVariant are removed from FilterBar 
        SelectionVariant #Open                 : {
            Text          : '{i18n>OpenView}',
            SelectOptions : [{
                $Type        : 'UI.SelectOptionType',
                PropertyName : status_code,
                Ranges       : [{
                    $Type  : 'UI.SelectionRangeType',
                    Option : #LT,
                    Low    : 11,
                    Sign   : #I
                }]
            }]
        } 
using something like this, the former available status_code filter with a valuehelp will not be shown anymore. 
If i read the documentation right, this should not be the case. I would expect, that the filter in the filter bar will just use/show the applied filter.  
Is this the intended behavior of the filter view, to remove used filters, a missuse from my side or maybe a bug. 
I was also adding the **Sign** annotation to get rid ofd the tooling warning from the SAP Fiori Tools. All the SDK docus do not use it and i think **I** option will be the default. Maybe that needs to be addressed to the tooling.  
This behavior is not only affecting ranges, using another view like  
SelectionVariant #HighPrio             : {
            Text          : '{i18n>HighPriorityView}',
            SelectOptions : [{
                $Type        : 'UI.SelectOptionType',
                PropertyName : priority_code,
                Ranges       : [{
                    $Type  : 'UI.SelectionRangeType',
                    Option : #EQ,
                    Low    : 3,
                    Sign   : #I
                }]
            }]
        }, 
also the **priority_code** filter will be removed from FilterBar. 
**Questions:** 
1) If this behavior is intended, is it possible to use multiple views while still showing all SelectionFields on the ListReport FilterBar in MulipleTableMode? 
2) How can i use SingleTableMode for this (or is this maybe currently not supported with SAPUI5 1.85.x)? 
Best  

        
    Answer is: In the meantime, found a solution for the SingleTableMode using
"controlConfiguration": {
  "@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem": {
    "tableSettings": {
      "quickVariantSelection": {
        "paths": [...]
instead views.path ( to the Service Modeler),
but still do not understand the rules, when and why a filter will be removed from FilterBar.

    Question Title: List Report Object Page App with SAP Fiori Tools in VSCode
    Question Body: 
            Hi, 
I'm currently trying to explore the creation of a simple app for FIORI as detailed here in VSCode. The extensions are installed and I have made it as the tutorial explains but when testing: with npm start or similar, I just get a blank page: 
 
 Something like this (BAS) should be loading: 
 
Some thoughts?Thank you.
        
    Answer is: Hi,Is the server you're connecting to the one described in the tutorial? Or are you trying to connect to another system (e.g. on premise )? If you're connecting to another system than described in the tutorial, you can try to set the ignoreCertError to true in the ui5.yaml file before launching the application using npm run start. (the system might be using a self signed certificate)If that doesn't solve your problem do you see any errors popping up in the terminal and / or the browser console?Best ,

    Question Body: 
            hi everyonewe have on-premise sap in intranet network and don't access to internet 
how can we use SAP Business Application Studio in this situation ? 
can install BAS in on-premise server ?

if we use vs code Can it meet all our needs? or any other ideand etc. 

        
    Answer is: Hi Sina,
SAP Business Application Studio is a cloud service that cannot be installed or accessed on intranet at the moment.
VSCode can be a good choice for  related development, as its interface is very similar to BAS in terms of usability. Not all BAS features are available in VSCode, but you can install extensions to partially remediate to that, in particular:

 SAP  Platform core data services plug-in
 SAP Fiori tools - Extension Pack

    Question Title: Local Annotations vs External Annotations
    Question Body: 
            Hi, 
We can generate fiori list reports using UI annotations in CDS and we also have annotation modeler to design the UI. which one is the best approach and why?. Can any one share the known thoughts.
        
    Answer is: Here's my two cents, you can do everything from the backend CDS view annotations itself and it is the best way as you have one place to control the annotations and cds views. We should only go with the modeler in the UI if it is not possible to add those annotations in the cds views or If the UI team wanted to create different apps for the same odata service with different UI look and feel.( Now this can also be avoided if in the backend we create 2 different consumption views or two different projection views ).So I guess only in the case if it is not possible to add those annotations in the CDS views (old SAP version or annotations not available) then it is better to go with annotation modeler.

    Question Title: FIORI Elements: SAPUI Version Requirement
    Question Body: 
            Hi Ian   
First of all, I hope you are safe and healthy during this pandemic.. 
Okay. So I want to create an app using fiori elements. What I know now is I need to match the SAP_UI version between the app and backend. And I found this. Please see below: 
 
And then checking my backend system, SAP_UI component is 7.52: 
 
Now in BAS during fiori element generation, I am at this screen and selected advanced options to select SAP UI version 1.52 which is the one compatible to my backend's SAP_UI component , at least according to the first picture. But what I see is that 1.65 is the lowest version I can select. 
 
Given that: 
 
 My first question is, does that mean my backend is not yet ready to use Fiori elements-based applications? 
 Aside from SAP_UI version, are there any other compatibility parameters I need to consider? 
 
Thank you very much, 

        
    Answer is: Hi   , 
Sorry for not responding to your query from August :(. I have only just noticed this today. Yes, we currently support ui5 version 1.65 and above in our generator. This was initially because it was the first version that supported both the Belize and Quartz themes that the generator offers. 
However, we are looking to update to support version 1.60 and above. 1.52 is going out of maintenance at the end of the year, as detailed in https://ui5.sap.com/versionoverview.html, so we are not currently planning to update to support back this far.

    Question Title: UploadCollection upload request not getting triggered in the First Instance
    Question Body: 
             s, 
I am going thru a bizarre error for the past 24 hours. I have a requirement of Uploading Documents. Hence I am using the UploadCollection Element from Ui5 Library. 
Everything is working fine but the only thing is the upload isn't happening in the first instance. I opened/reloaded my UploadCollection Page, when I click upload, beforeUploadStart event handler gets triggered where I am setting the URL to post the document, Then it goes to the uploadComplete handler; but by this time, a network request should have been sent to the URL that I set on the beforeUploadStart handler, but checking the Network Tab in the Dev tools, there isn't any request triggered. 
The catch is when I select a document for the second time or so forth times as usual the beforeUploadStart event handler gets triggered and once this handler completed executing, a network request has been sent to the URL path that I set on the beforeUploadStart event handler. Why it isn't getting triggered on the first instance when I open/re-load the UploadCollection Page. Please find my code:Your immediate help is much appreciated.

    Answer is: Helo Guys, 
This post might help! https://github.com/SAP/openui5/issues/786 
As for now, the UploadCollection Element is little buggy. 
Here is what I did, I just set a URL model and I set the property url={URLModel>/url} in the XML view, and on the controller init method I set the value of the URLModel. By this way the it got posted even on the first Instance of the Upload.

    Question Title: Can I use SAP Fiori Elements and SAP Fiori Tools?
    Question Body: 
            Hi,we have on premise SAP HANA Version 1.00.122.20.1536720790.Can I use SAP Fiori Elements and SAP Fiori Tools?Thank you!
        
    Answer is: YesSAP Fiori Elements is a UI technology that runs in the browser. It doesn't matter which backend technology serves the data.SAP Fiori Tools are a plugin for the SAP Business Application Studio / VS Code to develop SAP Fiori Elements Apps.

            Hi Team, 
I couldn't start the List Report i created via VS Code. I executed command "npm start" 
Below is the screenshot.

    Question Title: Attachment Service using FORI Tools VSCode/Business Application Studio
    Question Body: 
            I can't figure out how to reference the attachmentservice using xs-app.json (as opposed to neo-app.json in neo/webide)  
I'm using an OData Connection (as opposed to an SAP System)  
The error I get is failed to load "'/resources/sap/se/mi/plm/lib/attachmentservice/library-preload.json': Not Found -" 
in webide I would right click the project, Select "Project" then "Add reference to library"  
anyone know how do do that in FIORI Tools with an Odata Connection? 
        
    Answer is: Hi Paul,
Can you try updating the ui5.yaml and ui5-local.yaml to add backend routing for "/resources/sap/se/mi/plm/lib/attachmentservice" for example: 
customMiddleware:
  - name: fiori-tools-proxy
    afterMiddleware: compression
    configuration:
      backend:
        - path: /sap
          url: https://hostname:port/
        - path: /resources/sap/se/mi/plm/lib/attachmentservice
          pathPrefix: /sap/bc/ui5_ui5/sap/plm_ath_cres1
          url: https://hostname:port
Also, ensure that the latest version of @sap/ux-ui5-tooling is installed in the project.
npm install @sap/ux-ui5-tooling@1.0.10 --save-dev 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-ui5-tooling

    Question Title: What are the prerequisites for developing Fiori Apps for SAP PP reports?
    Question Body: 
            Hellp All ,  
I am looking for development of custom SAP PP report for fiori apps. 
How we can achieve our goal so that end user can able see sap report from mobile app itself?
        
    Answer is: Hi,There are no other prerequisites for PP reports in Fiori compared to any other Fiori apps. In general what you'll need is following:Web IDE /  Business Application Studio (cloud) or VS Code / Eclipse (local) for developmentA SAP NetWeaver gateway enabled system (in case you're using SAP ECC the best practice is to have SAP NetWeaver Gateway setup in HUB deployment, if you're using  the best practice is to use the embedded SAP NetWeaver Gateway)Fiori Launchpad to give users access to your apps (On-premise launchpad or SAP  Platform portal service)In case you're going for a cloud-based development / deployment approach, you'll also need to setup a SAP  ConnectorThe enable users to use your apps on there mobile you can just use the standard Fiori Client which can be found in the app store.Best , Klap

    Question Title: How to create dynamic analytical KPI tiles for custom application?
    Question Body: 
            we implemented bookmark tiles to show charts in our custom application using service /UI2/PAGE_BUILDER_PERS. now we want to enable KPI's to show analytical details, the service we used is not supported to show KPI's. And we have used another service /UI2/PAGE_BUILDER_CUST to create KPI tiles, which is not supported for custom applications. Is there a way to create dynamic analytical KPI tiles for custom application? 
 Anyhow, I have seen a scenario creating analytical KPI tiles using smart business service KPI Fiori apps, which is not custom to my application. 
 
 initial tile is created using smart business service KPI Fiori apps, second and third tiles are created using service /UI2/PAGE_BUILDER_CUST.
        
    Answer is:  Drona D,
I think best option to achieve this is to create a new KPI Tile using the KPI Modeler app (Edit Tile).
Then you define the drilldown as "others" (not "Generic" nor "Analysis Path Framework") and then place in there your own semantic object/action which points to your custom application:

You can even pass parameters if you need it, just as you would normally do on the Launchpad customizing page.
That way you can combine a KPI Tile with a custom application.
Hope this helps!
Cheers,

            Hi, 
Do you know how to use Fiddler as a proxy to review Fiori launchpad SSL certificate error while using X.509 certificate-based authentication?
